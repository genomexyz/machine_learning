[Radio transmission sound]

[Inside the ship, Ebony Maw walks among the bodies of dead Asgardians. Heimdall, badly wounded, reaches out as if he would stop Maw as he passes, but lacks the strength. Maw steps over them with no mind as he speaks, as if they were scattered pieces of dirty clothing on a bedroom floor.]

Ebony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan.... You may think this is suffering... no. It is salvation. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile... [Corvus Glaive stabs one of the lingering Asgardians] for even in death, you have become Children of Thanos.

[Loki stands with the Black Order. He watches Thanos, shrouded in darkness and light, a vague silhouette.]

Thanos: [Looking out the large window we saw at the end of Thor: Ragnarok] I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right... yet to fail, nonetheless. [Lifts Thor by the neck of his breastplate. Thor struggles feebly.] It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say... I AM.

[Thanos holds up his hand to reveal the Infinity Gauntlet, which already hosts the violet Power Stone.]

Thor: [Now being held by Thanos with one huge hand wrapping around his head; blood drools from his mouth] You talk too much.

Thanos: [To Loki] The Tesseract, or your brother's head. I assume you have a preference.

[The Black Order heft their weapons or smirks, as appropriate.]

Loki: Oh, I do. Kill away!

[Thanos' face expresses surprise briefly before presses the gauntlet to Thor's left temple. The Power Stone glows brightly. Thor screams hoarsely.]

Loki: [Starts losing his cool demeanor almost immediately as Thor suffers, and breaks after only a few moments] ALL RIGHT, STOP!

Thor: We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.

[Loki glances at Thor like he knows something he doesn't. He lifts his right hand into the air and the Tesseract reveals itself.]

Thor: You really are the worst brother.

Loki: [While holding the Tesseract out to Thanos and advancing] I assure you, brother... the sun will shine on us again.

Thanos: Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.

Loki: Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian. And for another... we have a Hulk.

[Thanos looks to his right just as a green and very angry mass slams into him. Loki dives for Thor, pulling both of them out of the way as the Tesseract skitters across the floor, and the Hulk charges Thanos. The Hulk pummels Thanos, forcing him backwards and shoving him into the wall of the ship. Maw stops Cull Obsidian from interfering.]

Ebony Maw: Let him have his fun.

[Thanos pries the Hulk's hands away; an expression of surprise and fear crosses his green face. After several hard blows, Thanos picks up the Hulk and slams him to the deck, defeated. Thor slams a metal bar across Thanos' back to no avail, is kicked across the deck by Thanos and is promptly bound in metal debris by Ebony Maw to keep him from interfering further.]

Heimdall: [Prays] Allfathers… let the dark magic flow through me one last... time.

[Heimdall summons the Bifrost, which carries the Hulk away; he meets Thor's eye.]

Thanos: That was a mistake.

[Thanos borrows Corvus's glaive and stabs Heimdall through the heart, twisting the blade in the wound.]

Thor: NO!!! [After Thanos kills Heimdall] You're going to die for that!

Ebony Maw: [Shuts Thor's mouth with his telekinesis] Shh.

Ebony Maw: [Kneels before Thanos, offering up the Tesseract] My humble personage… bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp.

[Thanos crushes the Tesseract, revealing the blue Space Stone. He blows some of the fractals away, fingering the Stone between his thumb and index, before placing it on the gauntlet, and is momentarily rocked by the surge of energy that pulses as the stone seats in its setting.]

Thanos: There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.

Proxima Midnight: [Kneeling] Father, we will not fail you.

Cull Obsidian: We're going to New York City and We will tear The Avengers Apart and Smash! Once and for all, my lord.

Loki: [Emerging from behind the Black Order] [cheerfully] If I might interject… if you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena.

Thanos: [Unimpressed] If you consider failure experience.

Loki: I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos, I... Loki... Prince of Asgard... [looks significantly at Thor] Odinson... the rightful King of Jotunheim... God of Mischief... do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity.

[Thor squints and notices a dagger materialize in Loki's hand. Loki braces himself, thrusts upward with lightning speed and attempts to stab Thanos, but is frozen in place by the Space Stone's power before the point could strike home.]

Thanos: "Undying?" You should choose your words more carefully.

[Thanos twists the dagger out of Loki's hand with his right hand, then takes hold of Loki's neck with the gauntlet and lifts him to eye level. Loki struggles, kicking, as his throat is squeezed. He makes eye contact with Thor before he increases his force on Loki's neck.]

Loki: [Giving up on fighting against Thanos] You will... never be... a god. [Thanos crushes Loki's neck, killing him.]

Thor: [Muffled] NO!

Thanos: [Walks over and drops Loki's body in front of Thor.] No resurrections this time.

[Thanos raises the gauntlet, sends violet Power fire through the remains of the Statesman, and uses the Space Stone to teleport away with the Black Order.]

Thor: No… Loki….

[Thor is released from his bonds. He crawls over to Loki's body -- which, unlike in The Dark World, has not returned to its Jotun form -- and lays his head down on Loki's chest, shedding tears for all that he has lost. The ship explodes.]

[The Bifrost continues its journey, bringing the Hulk across space to Earth.]

[Sanctum Sanctorum, New York City]

[Doctor Strange, Master of the Mystic Arts, proceeds down the main steps of the Sanctum with Wong.]

Stephen Strange: [Dressed in casual American clothes.] Seriously? You don't have any money?

Wong: [Dressed as Wong is always dressed.] Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.

Stephen Strange: I'll tell the guys at the deli. [Wryly] Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.

Wong: Oh, wait, wait, wait, I think I have 200.

Stephen Strange: Dollars?

Wong: Rupees.

Stephen Strange: Which is?

Wong: Uh, buck and a half.

Stephen Strange: What do you want?

Wong: I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.

[Bruce crash-lands through the Sanctum stairs. The Cloak of Levitation swirls around Strange's shoulders immediately.]

Bruce Banner: Thanos is coming. He's coming...

Stephen Strange: [Sharing a look with Wong, and now fully in his mage attire] Who?

[Title Screen: Avengers: Infinity War]

[Public Park, New York City, day. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts walk on having a conversation.]

Tony Stark: Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding.

Pepper Potts: [Laughing slightly and talking over him] You're totally rambling.

Tony Stark: [Also talking over her] No, I'm not.

Pepper Potts: Lost me.

Tony Stark: Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?

Pepper Potts: Yeah.

Tony Stark: Okay, and then you're like, 'Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?', 'Oh! Someone's watching,' ''m gonna go in my pants.'

Pepper Potts: Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee.

Tony Stark: Yes.

Pepper Potts: Yeah. Everybody has that.

Tony Stark: Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?

Pepper Potts: [Nodding in understanding] Right.

Tony Stark: Morgan! Morgan.

Pepper Potts: So you woke up, and thought that we were...

Tony Stark: Expecting.

Pepper Potts: Yeah.

Tony Stark: [Becoming excited] Yes?

Pepper Potts: [Shaking her head] No.

Tony Stark: I had a dream about it. It was so real.

Pepper Potts: If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that.

[Pepper unties his jacket sleeves and taps Tony's chest attachment.]

Tony Stark: I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles.

Pepper Potts: It's not helping your case, OK?

Tony Stark: No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-

Pepper Potts: [Insistently] You don't need that.

Tony Stark: I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future uses, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know...

Pepper Potts: Shirts?

Tony Stark: You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.

Pepper Potts: You should have shirts in your closet.

Tony Stark: Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.

Pepper Potts: Yes.

Tony Stark: I will. [Tony kisses Pepper.]

[Doctor Strange comes through a portal.]

Stephen Strange: Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.

[Tony and Pepper are understandably shocked.]

Tony Stark: I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?

Stephen Strange:We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake.

Tony Stark: And who's "we"?

Bruce Banner: [Emerges from behind Doctor Strange] Hey, Tony.

Tony Stark: [Looking surprised] Bruce.

Bruce Banner: Pepper.

Pepper Potts: Hi.

Tony Stark: You okay?

[Bruce gives Tony a desperate hug, not answering. After everything he has been through, we understand.]

[Back at the Sanctum Sanctorum.]

Wong: [Using magic to show the universe and five out of six Infinity Stones.] From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence.

Stephen Strange: [Each Stone lights up as Dr. Strange names them.] Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.

[Dr. Strange opens the Eye of Agamotto, revealing the Time Stone emitting emerald light.]

Tony Stark: [Very attentive] Tell me his name again.

Bruce Banner: Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York. That's him.

Tony Stark: [Speaking to himself] This is it... What's our timeline?

Bruce Banner: No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony...

Stephen Strange: He can destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

Tony Stark: [Leans against a cauldron, stretching like he's about to go for a run.] Did you seriously just say "hitherto undreamt of"?

Stephen Strange: Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

Tony Stark: Is that what this is.... ?

[The Cloak of Levitation smacks Tony's arm, surprising him.]

Tony Stark: [Looking offended] [Straightening himself] I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?

Stephen Strange: No can do.

Wong: We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives.

Tony Stark: And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so....

Stephen Strange: Stark Raving Hazelnuts.

Tony Stark: It's not bad.

Stephen Strange: A bit chalky.

Wong: A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge is our favorite.

Bruce Banner: That's a thing?

Tony Stark: Whatever. Point is: things change.

Stephen Strange: Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.

Tony Stark: And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us.

Stephen Strange: Well, if we don't do our jobs.

Tony Stark: [Slightly condescending] What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?

Stephen Strange: [Completely calm] Protecting your reality, douchebag.

[You seriously can't tell who's sarcasm is better.]

Bruce Banner: Okay, guys, could we table this discussion right now? The fact is that we have this Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now.

Tony Stark: [Awkwardly] Yeah, that's the... thing.

Bruce Banner: What do you mean?

Tony Stark: Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline.

Bruce Banner: What? Tony, you lost another super bot?

Tony Stark: I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.

Stephen Strange: Who could find Vision, then?

Tony Stark: [Quietly to himself] Shit. [To the other men in a normal tone] Probably Steve Rogers.

Stephen Strange: [Sighing in exasperation] Oh, great.

Tony Stark: Maybe. But... [Sighs]

Bruce Banner: [Missing the events of the Avengers' Civil War] Call him.

Tony Stark: It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?

Bruce Banner: No.

Tony Stark: The Avengers broke up. We're toast.

Bruce Banner: [Rather surprised and slightly let-down] Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?

Tony Stark: Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.

Bruce Banner: [Almost pleading] Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.

[Tony hesitates, before pulling out the cellular phone Steve mailed him, muttering 'flip phone'. It seems as though he brings it everywhere, always ready to call his lost friend. Before clicking "Call", he pauses, distracted by an unusual rumbling.]

Tony Stark: Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?

Stephen Strange: [Looking up at his forelock fluttering] Not at the moment, no.

[Tony looks at the Hulk-made opening through the ceiling and sees debris flying by outside. He exits the Sanctum through the front door and scans the chaotic surroundings, the camera shaking around in this following long take to illustrate the chaos -- people running and screaming in alarm, traffic becoming impossibly tangled, a litter-filled wind like a nor'easter's. A woman falls nearly at his feet and he helps her up.]

Tony Stark: You okay?

[The woman ignores him and runs away. A car crashes in on a pole behind Tony.]

Tony Stark: Help him! Wong, Doc.

Bruce Banner: Go! Got it!

Tony Stark: [Putting on his sunglasses] F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?

F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Not sure, I'm working on it.

Tony Stark: Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!

Stephen Strange: [Bands of spells are readied around his forearms] Might wanna use it.

[A mechanical hum grows louder as Tony approaches the intersection. As he turns the corner, he sees a huge circular ship floating over Bleecker Street.]

[On a school bus, the hairs on Peter Parker's arms stand up. He looks out the window and sees the ship.]

Peter Parker: [Tapping his best friend in the seat in front of him] Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.

Ned Leeds: [Turns around and sees the spaceship] Holy shit! We're all gonna die! There's a spaceship!

[Students scramble to the windows in the back to see the spaceship.]

[Peter quickly slides on one of his Stark-made webshooters, and webs the emergency exit lever on the opposite side of the bus.]

School Bus Driver, Stan Lee: What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before?

[Peter jumps out the window, clinging to the side of the bus and pulling on his mask before leaping over the side of the bridge, shooting a web-line and swinging free. He makes his way hastily towards the ship.]

Tony Stark: F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders.

F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Will do.

[Doctor Strange throws the Winds of Watoomb over Bleeker Street, and winks at Tony. The dust clears. Tony is begrudgingly amused for a split second.]

[Then Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian exit the ship by transmat.]

Ebony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to...

Tony Stark: [Echoing the familiarly defiant 2008 Tony Stark] I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here.

Ebony Maw: [Looks at Doctor Strange] Stonekeeper... [Gestures to Tony] Does this chattering animal speak for you?

Stephen Strange: Certainly not. I speak for myself. [Magical shields are readied with his fists, stepping forward.] But you’re trespassing in this city and on this planet. [Wong emulates him.]

Tony Stark: It means get lost, Squidward!

Ebony Maw: He exhausts me.

Cull Obsidian: [Two untranslated syllables]

Ebony Maw: Bring me the Stone.

Cull Obsidian: [Three untranslated syllables] [He drops his huge alien hammer and drags it along as he obeys his brethren.]

Tony Stark: Banner, you want a piece?

Bruce Banner: No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?

Tony Stark: That's right.

[Bruce attempts to release the Hulk. Instead of Hulk coming out easily, the most that turns green is Bruce's neck.]

Tony Stark: Been a while. Good to have you, buddy.

Bruce Banner: I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man.

Tony Stark: Where's your guy?

Bruce Banner: I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing.

Tony Stark: There's no time for a thing.

Bruce Banner: I know.

Tony Stark: [Points at the approaching Obsidian] That's the thing right there. Let's go.

[Bruce gives out a loud grunt, but fails to release the Hulk. Doctor Strange stares at Tony and Bruce in disbelief.]

Tony Stark: [Glances at Doctor Strange] Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.

Bruce Banner: Tony, I'm sorry. [Stammers] Either I can't or he won't--

Tony Stark: It's okay. Hey, stand down. [to Wong] Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

Wong: I have him.

Bruce Banner: Damn it.

[As Cull Obsidian approaches the team, Tony dons his nanotech Iron Man suit in the space of three steps. He grows a shield on one arm to protect himself, then grows a set of blasters that easily throw the Dwarf back to Maw, who gestures and deflects his massive companion into some cars.]

Bruce Banner: Where'd that come from?

Tony Stark: It's nano-tech. You like it? A little someth--

[Ebony Maw creates a spike of earth that throws Iron Man far up, and attacks the rest of the team with uprooted trees and other debris. Wong summons the Shield of the Seraphim.]

Stephen Strange: Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us....

[Doctor Strange teleports Bruce to a nearby park along with half a taxi. Iron Man returns and joins the fight, pushing a car thrown by Maw back at him. Maw cuts it in half and lets the pieces fly past him, untouched.]

Tony Stark: Gotta get that stone outta here, now.

Stephen Strange: It stays with me.

Tony Stark: Exactly. Bye.

[Iron Man flies through Ebony Maw's obstacle course but is cut short by Cull Obsidian's hammer, sending him through a building and into the park at high speed, plowing into the ground and fetching up against a tree.]

Bruce Banner: [Rushing over to Iron Man] Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? Bad?

Tony Stark: Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?

Bruce Banner: I'm trying. He won't come out.

[Cull Obsidian arrives at the park and throws his hammer at Bruce and Iron Man.]

Tony Stark: Hammer. [Pushes Bruce out of the way.]

[Iron Man's energy beam deflects off Cull Obsidian's shield, slicing down trees. Bruce barely evades one.]

Bruce Banner: [Crawling out from under the branches. Desperate and confused] Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me? [Starts slapping himself multiple times] Come out! Come out! Come out!

Hulk: [Half of Bruce's face becomes the Hulk.] Nooooooo! [Bruce falls back exhausted into his tree.]

Bruce Banner: What do you mean, "no"?!

[Iron Man is knocked down by Obsidian, who is about to deliver a decisive blow, but the alien's hammer is easily caught by Spider-Man.]

Peter Parker: Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?

Tony Stark: Kid, where'd you come from?

Peter Parker: Field trip to MoMA.

[Cull Obsidian grabs Spider-Man and throws him away.]

Peter Parker: What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?

Tony Stark: He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.

[Wong and Doctor Strange fight Maw. Maw lifts several bricks from the ground and turns them into sharp points. He sends them towards Wong and Doctor Strange. The two make portals and boomerang them back towards Maw. Maw moves a car to protect himself, but one spike still hits his head, creating a cut. Angered, Maw uses a broken fire hydrant's water stream to knock Wong back several meters, rendering him unconscious.]

[Doctor Strange snaps a whip of magical energy to bind Maw's hands and yanks, but Maw flies forward with the pull and pins Doctor Strange upside-down against a building, using the bricks to trap the Sorcerer Supreme.]

Ebony Maw: Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.

[Maw tries to grab the amulet holding the Time Stone but jerks back when it burns his hand.]

Stephen Strange: It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.

Ebony Maw: [Vehemently] Then I'll take it off your corpse.

[Maw pulls Doctor Strange away from the building and throws him to the ground. Doctor Strange starts the gestures to use the Eye of Agamotto, but utility cables first pin Doctor Strange's arms, interrupting the spell and closing the Eye, while another cable winds around his torso, then tightens around his throat.]

Stephen Strange: You'll find... removing a dead man's spell... troublesome.

Ebony Maw: You'll only wish you were dead. [Doctor Strange falls unconscious and to the ground; Maw raises a portion of street pavement to use as a carrier, but the Cloak of Levitation works its master loose of the cable spiral and flies Doctor Strange away.] NO!

Tony Stark: [Still fighting Cull Obsidian, as Doctor Strange passes through the park.] Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.

Peter Parker: On it!

[Spider-Man chases Ebony Maw, floating speedily and upright on a small platform of burbling debris leaving a deep rut in the streets, who in turn chases the Cloak-driven Doctor Strange through Manhattan; Maw attacks him, throwing a Rocket Mortgage billboard at Spider-Man to be rid of him.]

Peter Parker: [Untangles himself] Not cool!

[Maw bends all the utility poles in the path of the fleeing Cloak, finally snagging the loyal garment and ripping it loose of its master. Spider-Man scoops up Doctor Strange before he hits the pavement, but before he can get away with the unconscious Doctor Strange, a cone of blue light starts pulling the mage inexorably upwards. Spider-Man grabs a light pole to anchor himself, but Maw uproots it, sending Doctor Strange, Cloak and teenager on their way to his ship.]

Peter Parker: Uhhh, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up!

Tony Stark: Hang on, kid. [Cull Obsidian's hammer doubles as a claw, pinning Iron Man to the ground and shorting his suit. As Obsidian jumps towards Iron Man, blades ready to end this fight, he is sent through a portal instead. The alien turns and leaps to return the same way, but Wong closes it rapidly -- only Obsidian's severed hand makes it back to the park. Bruce kicks the hand away with a noise of disgust.]

Tony Stark: [Iron Man shakes himself free of the Dwarf's weapon, now powerless.] Wong, you're invited to my wedding. [Iron Man begins to fly towards the large ship] Give me a little juice, F.R.I.D.A.Y. [Iron Man's foot thrusters morph together into a single larger jet and increase his speed considerably.]

[Ebony Maw walks towards the controls of the ship, Doctor Strange's unconscious body floating face-down behind him, and prepares to leave Earth's atmosphere.]

Tony Stark: [Still in pursuit of the ship and his protege.] Unlock 17-A. [A pod launches from the upstate Avengers headquarters and curves up to the accelerating circular ship.] Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.

Peter Parker: But you said save the wizard! [Spider-Man, gasping from lack of oxygen, pulls off his mask] I can't breathe!

Tony Stark: You're too high up. You're running out of air.

Peter Parker: Yeah! That makes sense.

[Peter passes out, free-falling, but not for long before the pod reaches him. It attaches itself to him, becoming the Iron Spider suit. Now being able to breathe, Spider-Man lands on a bottom part of the ship, standing up heroically.]

Peter Parker: Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!

Tony Stark: Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home.

F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Yep.

[A large parachute extends from the new suit, snatching Spider-Man free of the ship's hull and him spiraling back to Earth.]

Peter Parker: OH, COME ON!

[Iron Man latches onto the hull and cuts a hole to board the ship, looking for wherever Strange and Ebony Maw went.]

F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.

Pepper Potts: [Sounding heavily worried] Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?

Tony Stark: Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res.

Pepper Potts: Why?

Tony Stark: [While looking at the ship around him] Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for a while.

Pepper Potts: Tell me you're not on that ship.

Tony Stark: Yeah.

Pepper Potts: God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship.

Tony Stark: Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

Pepper Potts: Come back here, Tony. I swear to God….

Tony Stark: Pep….

Pepper Potts: Come back here right now! Come back!

F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Boss, we're losing her. I'm going, too….

[Spider-Man is revealed to have managed to shoot a web to the outside of the ship, foiling his parachute, and clambers inside a slowly-closing chamber.]

Peter Parker: Oh my God! [Looks at the rapidly-receding planet behind him] I should have stayed on the bus....

[Ebony Maw, hands engaged in the ship's steering mechanism, accelerates into hyperspace.]

[Meanwhile, back in New York]

[Bruce finds Tony's flip-phone in the debris on the street and picks it up thoughtfully. Wong opens up a portal back to the Sanctum.]

Bruce Banner: Where you going?

Wong: The Time Stone's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do?

Bruce Banner: [Holding Rogers' cell phone] I'm gonna make a call.

[Wong nods in understanding and closes the portal, not to be seen again for the rest of the movie. Banner holds Steve Rogers' cell phone and makes a call.]

[Screen title: SPACE]

[Camera pans around a brightly colored planet with ice rings to the Benatar. The Guardians of the Galaxy are travelling to investigate a distress call to the tune of "Rubberband Man".]

Peter Quill: [Chair-dancing to the song] Sing it, Drax!

[Drax is snoring with his mouth open from his seat in front of Quill. Gamora lip-syncs with the song along with Quill.]

Rocket: [Yawns] Why are we doing this again?

Gamora: [Annoyed] It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying.

Rocket: I get that, but why are we doing it?

Peter Quill: 'Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese [Quill rubs his thumb against his other fingers] for our help.

Gamora: [Waves her index finger at Quill] Which isn't the point.

Peter Quill: [Points back at Gamora] Which isn't the point... I mean… if he doesn't pony up….

Drax: We'll take his ship.

Rocket: Exactly!

Peter Quill: B-b-b-bingo!

[Gamora looks up at Quill in concern. Quill returns her look and grimaces a "don't worry about it" expression at her.]

Mantis: [Reading her console] We are arriving.

Peter Quill: All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces. [Groot rolls his eyes as Mantis makes a snarl. Groot's handheld Terran-vintage video game beeps.] Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again. [Game continues beeping] Groot.

Groot: [In a mocking tone] I am Groot! (Translation: Shut up, bitch!)

Peter Quill: Whoa!

Rocket: Language!

Gamora: Hey!

Drax: Wow.

Peter Quill: You got some acorns on you, kid.

Rocket: Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna SMASH THAT THING TO PIECES!

[Groot rolls his eyes.]

[The Benatar decelerates, and Thanos' devastation suddenly covers the Guardians' field of view, revealing the distress signal to be the one from the Asgardian vessel at the beginning of the movie. Bodies are seen floating dead in space along with the pieces of the shredded ship.]

Mantis: What happened?

Rocket: Looks like we're not getting paid.

[With a thump, Thor's body is plastered to the hull of the ship.]

Rocket: [Waving his hands] Wipers! Wipers! Get it off!

[Thor’s eye opens; all gasp.]

[Cut to the Guardians settling the still-unconscious Thor onto an examination table.]

Peter Quill: How the hell is this dude still alive?

Drax: [Sounding awed] He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... this is a man. A handsome, muscular man.

Peter Quill: [A little dented] I'm muscular.

Rocket: Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat.

Peter Quill: Yeah, right.

Drax: It's true. You have gained a little weight…. [Drax motions to his chin and belly.]

[Gamora leaves Quill's side at Thor's right, and circles around the foot of the table.]

Peter Quill: What? Gamora, do you think I'm…

Mantis: He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.

Drax: It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.

Peter Quill: Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bow-flex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

Rocket: You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

Gamora: [Reaches Drax's side and picks up Thor's left arm, stroking his triceps] It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.

Peter Quill: [Snidely to Gamora] Stop massaging his muscles. [Gamora, annoyed, drops the arm with a thump; quietly to Mantis] Wake him up.

Mantis: [Places hand on Thor's forehead] Wake.

[Thor awakens, sitting up violently and throwing himself off the table to stumble a few steps away, then turning to see his hosts all pointing their weapons of choice at him; Groot is still playing his game.]

Thor: Who the hell are you guys?

[Cut to later as the Guardians stand around Thor eating soup.]

Gamora: The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre....

Drax: Including my own.

Gamora: If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this. [She snaps her fingers.]

Thor: You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

Drax: Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.

Thor: Your father killed my brother. [Thor stands and strides towards Gamora aggressively.]

Peter Quill: Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do. [Thor softens a bit.]

Thor: Families can be tough. [He claps a hand on Gamora's shoulder] Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister... that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain.

[Peter glares at Thor's hand on Gamora's shoulder, on the verge of full snarl, and moves around her to push between her and Thor.]

Peter Quill: And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes--

Thor: [Not paying attention as he stares at his soup spoon] I need a hammer, not a spoon…. (He attempts to fiddle with machinery) How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe… maybe a birth date or something….

Peter Quill: What are you doing?

Thor: Taking your pod.

Peter Quill: [Clears his throat then deepens his voice] No, you're not! [Mimics Thor’s accent] You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir.

Rocket: Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?

Peter Quill: No.

Drax: You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.

Peter Quill: No I'm not.

Mantis: [Gasp] He just did it again!

Peter Quill: This is my voice!

Thor: [Steps closer to Quill] Are you mocking me?

Peter Quill: Are you mocking me?

Thor: Stop it. You did it again.

Peter Quill: He's trying to copy me.

Thor: Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.

Gamora: Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.

Thor: Knowhere.

Mantis: He must be going somewhere.

Peter Quill: [Voice now normal] No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food. [To Thor as he rummages through their food stores.]

Thor: Not anymore.

Gamora: Thor… why would he go to Knowhere?

Thor: Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector.

Peter Quill: If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

Thor: Or a genius.

Gamora: [To Thor] How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?

Thor: There's six stones out there. [Finishes rummaging and steps in front of Gamora] Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers.

Peter Quill: The 'Avengers'?

Thor: [By way of explanation.] Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

Mantis: Like Kevin Bacon?

Thor: [Pause] He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome.

Gamora: Then we have to go to Knowhere now.

Thor: Wrong! Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.

Drax: That's a made up word.

Thor: All words are made up.

[It's official: mind blown.]

Rocket: Hold up, Nidavellir is real? [Climbing on to the table] Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend. [Increasingly gleeful] They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please.

Thor: The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you.

Rocket: Rabbit?

Thor: Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need. [To Rocket] I assume you're the captain, sir?

Rocket: You're very perceptive.

Thor: You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?

Rocket: Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.

Thor: Wonderful.

Peter Quill: Except for that I'm the captain.

Thor: Quiet!

Peter Quill: That's my backpack.

Rocket: Go sit down.

Peter Quill: [To Thor] Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to… [gropes for "Nidavellir"] Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?

Thor: The Thanos killing kind.

Peter Quill: Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?

Thor: No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.

Rocket: Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?

Thor: A little bit. Yeah.

Gamora: If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop.

Thor: He already is.

Rocket: I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool.

Thor: So cool. [Smiles a big grin.]

Peter Quill: [To Rocket] For the record… I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.

Rocket: You know, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill. [As he enters the pod] Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain.

Thor: I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye.

[The Guardians nod or wave farewell as Thor, Rocket and Groot depart. Cut to Scotland, where Vision and Wanda Maximoff are sharing a room. Wanda is in bed while Vision, in a human glamour, watches out a window.]

[High-pitched trilling]

Vision: [Gasps and holds his hand to the Mind Stone in pain.]

Wanda Maximoff: Vis? Is it the stone again?

Vision: It's as if it's speaking to me.

Wanda Maximoff: What does it say?

Vision: I don't... I don't know. But something... 

[The stone trills again and Vision flinches. Wanda takes his face in her hands. Vision turns his head so he can kiss her left palm, then presses Wanda's hand to the Mind Stone.]

Vision: Tell me what you feel.

[Wanda gestures, her hand emanating her red swirling energy. She seems confused.]

Wanda Maximoff: I just feel you.

[They kiss. Cut to later, where the two are going on a stroll.]

 Wanda Maximoff: So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.

Vision: What if I miss that train?

Wanda Maximoff: There is an 11.

Vision: What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?

Wanda Maximoff: You gave Stark your word.

Vision: I'd rather give it to you.

Wanda Maximoff: There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises.

Vision: Not to each other. [He puts his hands on her shoulders] Wanda… for two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know. [Stammers] You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself -- I, I... I think...

Wanda Maximoff: It works.

Vision: It works.

Vision: Then stay. Stay with me.

[Wanda looks down, but then her eyes and attention drift to her left.]

Vision: [Suddenly very uncertain] Or not. If I'm overstepping…

[Wanda steps over to a better view of the TV in the kebab shop at which they had stopped, drawing Vision with her. It shows coverage of the invasion of New York, the alien antagonists, and the disappearance of Tony Stark.]

Wanda Maximoff: [Fearful] What are they?

Vision: What the stone was warning me about. [He kisses her hand] I have to go.

Wanda Maximoff: No, Vision. Vision, if that's true… then maybe going isn't the best idea.

Vision: Wanda, I… [Corvus Glaive appears suddenly behind Vision, stabbing him through the back. Vision screams, loses his glamour to return to his green, red and gold appearance, and is thrown down into the street.]

Wanda Maximoff: Vision! [She circles her hands, gathering up energy for a counterattack when Proxima Midnight blasts her from behind, knocking the Scarlet Witch across the street and through a bistro's window.]

[Corvus Glaive pins Vision down and digs the point of his high-tech glaive into Vision's forehead in an attempt to extract the Mind Stone.]

[The Scarlet Witch commits her own surprise attack, blasts both of the aliens away, then lifts Vision and herself into a nearby courtyard, from where the Scarlet Witch drags him to rest in a concealed alleyway.]

Vision: The blade. It stopped me from phasing.

Wanda Maximoff: Is that even possible?

Vision: It isn't supposed to be. [His voice distorts electronically] My systems are failing. [The Scarlet Witch gestures over his gaping wound, using her magic to knit him back together. Vision continues in a gasping, wry tone] I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.

[Corvus Glaive suddenly arrives, knocking the Scarlet aside and grabbing Vision into the air,]

Wanda Maximoff: Vis!

[Corvus flies away with Vision, slamming him against several walls. Meanwhile, Proxima engages the Scarlet Witch with her staff weapon and they too begin to fight.]

Corvus Glaive: [To Vision] Give up the Stone, and she lives.

[Vision flies with Corvus to the roof of what appears to be a church, ricocheting off the stone church tower and onto the metal-clad roof.]

[Simultaneously, Proxima and the Scarlet Witch fight below, staff weapon versus magic energy hands until Proxima uses the blaster effect of her weapon to knock the Scarlet Witch meters away, stunning her as Proxima leaps down, brandishing her weapon within bare inches of the Scarlet Witch's face, only held back by the Scarlet Witch's powers]

[Furiously, Vision pummels Corvus, then throws him across the roof, firing a beam from the Mind Stone. Corvus uses his glaive to deflect the beam, splitting it into several beams, cutting up Edinburgh's ancient stone like butter, until one branch finally reflects back at Vision, slamming him into the wall behind him.]

[Down below, the Scarlet Witch has blocked Proxima's staff once again when she hears an agonized cry from Vision. Desperation strengthens her to throw Proxima through the burning lorry sliced in half by the split Stone beam, stunning the alien. The Scarlet Witch then flies up to the roof where Glaive has pinned Vision and is again attempting to remove the Mind Stone.]

Wanda Maximoff: Hands off.

[The Scarlet Witch casts a bolt of magic which throws Corvus back through the wall and down a shaft, then flies the two of them away again. Proxima, who has recovered, shoots a bolt from her weapon, causing them to fall from the air and down through the roof of Edinburgh Waverley Train Station. Wanda crawls over to Vision, who cannot muster the strength to stand.]

Wanda Maximoff: [Hushed voice, pleading.] Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go.

Vision: Please. Please leave.

Wanda Maximoff: You asked me to stay.... I'm staying.

Vision: Please.

Wanda Maximoff: Get up.

[Behind them, Proxima and Corvus crash through the roof and advance on them, brandishing their weapons. the Scarlet Witch moves protectively in front of Vision, building power in her hands.]

[An express train passes behind Wanda, and Proxima cocks her head as if aware of another's presence. Confused, the Scarlet Witch also turns and looks over her left shoulder. As the last train car passes, we see a silhouette on the far side of the platform. Proxima throws her weapon at the shadowy figure, but it is deftly caught just before the figure steps from the shadows.]

[As the Avengers theme kicks in, we now recognize a bearded and furious Steve Rogers (Captain America) as he steps into the light. Vision and the Scarlet Witch look hopeful and relieved. While all parties are distracted, Sam Wilson (Falcon) swoops in and kicks Proxima across the platform and through the closed cafe's security gate and furniture. Swooping around, he fires on Corvus.]

[At the same time, Captain America throws Proxima's weapon to Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) who engages Corvus, ducking under his swing, stabbing him in the gut and executing a flying kick to knock him backwards.]

[Proxima, who has rushed back to the fight, summons her weapon back to her hand and attacks Black Widow. Captain America leaps forward, rolls, scoops up Corvus's dropped glaive and holds her off. Black Widow joins in with her own escrima sticks. While the three are fighting, Falcon returns and again kicks Proxima backwards; she scuttles over to the prone Corvus. Falcon draws both of his Steyr SPP submachine pistols on the couple.]

Proxima Midnight: [To Glaive] Get up.

Corvus Glaive: I can't.

Natasha Romanoff: [Coolly] We don't wanna kill you. But we will.

Proxima Midnight: You'll never get the chance again.

[Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive depart as they are beamed up. The glaive is snatched from Captain America's hand as well.]

Sam Wilson: [To Vision] Can you stand?

Vision: [Electricity shimmers over his surface, and his voice distorts] Thank you, Captain.

Steve Rogers: [Nods] Let's get you on the jet.

Natasha Romanoff: [Closing the doors to the Quinjet, while addressing Wanda] I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances.

Wanda Maximoff: I'm sorry. We just wanted time.

Sam Wilson: Where to, Cap?

Steve Rogers: Home.

[Cut to the past, at Gamora's home planet Zen-Whoberi during Thanos' massacre. Gamora and her mother are hiding; the sounds of guns and screaming are outside.] 

Gamora's Mother: [To Young Gamora] Shh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe.

[An explosion goes off close by and Gamora screeches by reflex, revealing their hiding spot.]

Child of Thanos: [Untranslated inquiry.]

[The door is smashed open and both Zehobereians scream.]

[Outside, it is utter chaos. Leviathans, Chitauri chariots and ring-ships fly overhead; explosions and energy bolts from numerous sources criss-cross the panicked population, felling them randomly; smoke arises from countless fires.]

Ebony Maw:  Zehobereians…

Young Gamora: [Being dragged by one arm through the crowds] Mother! Where's my mother?!

Ebony Maw: Zen-Whoberis... Choose a side, or die.

Young Gamora: Mother! [She punches at the arm of the one dragging her who surprisingly drops her arm and leaves.]

Ebony Maw: One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few.

[Gamora turns and finds herself facing Thanos in his full Titan armor.]

Thanos: What's wrong, little one?

Young Gamora: My mother. Where is my mother?

Thanos: [Kneels down to Gamora] What's your name?

Young Gamora: Gamora.

Thanos: You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you. [Thanos offers his hand; she wraps her little fingers around one massive finger, and he leads her to a pavilion, where he crouches to her eye level again and produces a small -- for him -- red-jeweled handle. Pressing the switch, razor-sharp blades pop out both ends.] Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other… [He balances it on one finger, overbalances it purposefully and catches it.] Here. You try.

[Thanos hands Gamora the dagger -- the handle is two child-palms' widths in length. She tries balancing it on her index finger.]

Ebony Maw: Now go in peace, and meet your Maker.

[One half of the crowd is shot down. The survivors scream in horror, and Gamora tries to turn but Thanos prevents her from seeing the massacre.]

Thanos: Concentrate. There! You've got it.

[Cut to the present, aboard the GUARDIANS’ ship. Gamora is brooding, activates the spring-action blades on the same dagger.]

Peter Quill: Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the "blow off your junk" kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to--

Gamora: I need to ask a favor.

Peter Quill: Yeah, sure.

Gamora: One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

Peter Quill: Which is what the grenades are for. [Gamora silences him with a look.] I'm sorry. What's the favor?

Gamora: If things go wrong… If Thanos gets me… I want you to promise me… you'll kill me.

Peter Quill: [A beat. Confusion.] What?

Gamora: I know something he doesn't. If he finds out… the entire Universe could be at risk.

Peter Quill:  What do you know?

Gamora: If I tell you, you'd know, too.

Peter Quill: If it's so important, shouldn't I?

Gamora: Only if you wanna die.

Peter Quill: Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?

Gamora: Just… trust me. And possibly, kill me.

Peter Quill: I mean, I'd like to. I really would… [Gamora silences him by covering his mouth with her hand.]

Gamora: Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.

Peter Quill: [A beat. One that rests with him significantly.] Okay.

[The two kiss, until an odd crunching sound startles them. Drax is standing in the corner.]

Peter Quill: Dude. How long have you been standing there?

Drax: An hour.

Peter Quill: An hour? Are you serious?

Drax: I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... that I become invisible to the eye... watch.

[Drax stands motionless, then very slowly raises his hand towards his mouth]

Peter Quill: You're eating a zarg-nut.

Drax: But my movement... was so slow... that it's imperceptible.

Peter Quill: Mmm, no. [Quill and Gamora shake their heads.]

Drax: I'm sure I'm invisible.

Mantis: Hi, Drax.

Drax: [Knowing when he is beat] Damn it.

[The Benatar flies towards a massive skull and flies through one eye-hole into a vast interior cavern. Screen title: KNOWHERE.]

Peter Quill: This place looks deserted.

Drax: I'm reading movement from the third quadrant.

Peter Quill: Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here.

[The four Guardians disembark and sneak into the Collector’s collection room, which is in ruins. Thanos is threatening the Collector while the Guardians hide behind rubble.]

Collector: I don't have it.

Thanos: Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.

[Quill stops, and holds up a fist meaning 'halt' in the silent language of soldiers. Everybody walks quietly past him.]

Thanos: I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering. [Thanos places a heavy boot on the middle of the Collector's chest and presses.]

Collector: [Strained] I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?

Thanos: I imagine it's like breathing for you.

Collector: Like suicide.

Thanos: So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.

Collector: I didn't know what it was.

Thanos: Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone?

Drax: Today...

Peter Quill: [Grasping the danger] Drax. Drax.

Drax: ...He pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.

Peter Quill: Drax, waaaaait! [Drax draws his long dagger from his leg scabbard.] Not yet, not yet, not yet. [Drax gives him a look and heads towards Thanos. Quill hurries as quietly as possible to catch up.] Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah.

Drax: No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.

[Quill starts to struggle with Drax when Mantis puts her hand on the back of Drax's head.]

Mantis: Sleeeep. [Drax is knocked out, his falling body causing a loud crash. Everybody ducks.]

[Thanos looks towards the sound, then picks up the Collector and throws him into a collecting case before walking towards the disturbance.]

Peter Quill: Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm... [Gamora moves towards Thanos] The other right!

[Gamora leaps on Thanos from a stack of boxes, swinging her sword at him. He snaps the sword-blade in half, and Gamora stabs him in the throat with the stub, his lower jaw sagging and himself letting out a hoarse groan, then he is stabbed in the chest with the red-jeweled dagger.]

Thanos: Why? [He falls down] Why you? Daughter… [He holds his hand out to her, blood pooling out from his neck wound, before collapsing completely. Gamora breaks down, sobbing.]

Peter Quill: [Surprised] That was quick.

Collector: Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!

[Suddenly, Thanos' disembodied voice fills the room.]

Thanos: Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing.

[The scene disappears -- everything in the room is destroyed and/or on fire, the Collector waving bye-bye as he and his case vanish.]

Thanos: That is, it was. Now… reality can be whatever I want.

[Thanos is quite alive and undamaged. He has the red Reality Stone seated in the Infinity Gauntlet.]

Gamora: [Her face still wet, but no longer crying] You knew I'd come.

Thanos: I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one.

[Gamora hesitates for a beat, then reaches for her broken sword. Thanos grabs her by the back of the neck and swings her around in front of him.]

Drax: Thanos!

[With a pulse of the Reality Stone, both Drax and Mantis are 'disassembled' -- Drax is turned into a stack of tumbling cubes, and Mantis becomes a ribbon version of herself.]

Peter Quill: [Moving in, his blaster pointed right at Thanos] Let her go, Grimace!

Gamora: Peter…

Peter Quill: [To Gamora] I told you to go right.

Gamora: Now? Really?

Peter Quill: You let her go!

Thanos: Ah, the boyfriend.

Peter Quill: I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go.

Gamora: Peter…

Peter Quill: Or I'm gonna blow that nut sack of a chin right off your face!

Gamora: Not him.

[Quill hesitates. He does not shoot anyone.]

Gamora: You promised! You promised.

Thanos: Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him. [to Quill] She's asked, hasn't she? Do it. [There is a very tense and unpleasant pause. Thanos rolls his head and shoves Gamora towards Quill’s gun, egging him on.] DO IT!!

Peter Quill: [Tearing up] I told you to go right.

Gamora: I love you, more than anything.

Peter Quill: I love you, too.

[Quill screws up his eyes and pulls the trigger -- but a stream of bubbles comes out. Thanos was playing him.]

Thanos: [Genuinely sincere] I like you.

[Thanos teleports Gamora and himself away as a stunned Quill picks up Gamora's sword, and his friends painfully re-assemble themselves, the Reality Stone's effects now subsiding in its absence.]

(Back on Earth, the Quinjet arrives at the upstate New York Avengers HQ while Col. James "Rhodey" Rhodes deals with the red tape in the holographic person of Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (Lt. Gen., USA Ret.).)

Secretary Ross: Still no word from Vision?

James Rhodes: Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.

Secretary Ross: On a stolen Quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.

James Rhodes: You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?

Secretary Ross: My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own.

James Rhodes: If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here.

Secretary Ross: I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.

James Rhodes: [Sounding a little bitter] That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that. [We get a good look at his leg braces]

Secretary Ross: You have second thoughts?

James Rhodes: Not anymore.

[The fugitive Avengers enter the room, Vision supported by Sam.]

Steve Rogers: Mr. Secretary.

Secretary Ross: You got some nerve. I'll give you that.

Natasha Romanoff: You could use some of that right now.

Secretary Ross: The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?

Steve Rogers: I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight. [Steve takes a step forward, looking right at Ross] And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too.

Secretary Ross: [To Rhodes] Arrest them.

James Rhodes: All over it. [Swipes off hologram; the computer beeps twice] That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap.

Steve Rogers: [Hugging Rhodes] You too, Rhodey. [Natasha gets her own embrace.]

James Rhodes: Well. You guys really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years.

Sam Wilson: Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.

Bruce Banner: Uh, I think you look great. [Rhodes and Natasha long round to see Bruce walking in from the opposite end of the room.] Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back.

Natasha Romanoff: Hi, Bruce.

Bruce Banner: Nat.

Sam Wilson: [Whispering] This is awkward.

[Cut to a shot of Natasha, Bruce, Steve, Rhodey, Wanda, and Vision in another room.]

James Rhodes: So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?

Wanda Maximoff: And they can clearly find us.

Bruce Banner: We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?

Natasha Romanoff: After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest.

Bruce Banner: Who's Scott?

Steve Rogers: Ant-Man.

Bruce Banner: There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's Stone.

Natasha Romanoff: Well then, we have to protect it.

Vision: No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… its molecular integrity could fail. [Vision addresses Wanda as he nears her.]

Wanda Maximoff: And you, with it. We're not having this conversation.

Vision: Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

Wanda Maximoff: That's too high a price.

Vision: [Takes her face gently in both hands] Only you have the power to pay it. [Wanda walks away, distressed] Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.

Steve Rogers: [Eyes diverted down] But it should. [Looks up at Vision] We don't trade lives, Vision.

Vision: [Walking toward Steve] Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?

[Steve takes a breath, but before he has a chance to answer, Bruce speaks.]

Bruce Banner: Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another.

Wanda Maximoff: You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?

Bruce Banner: I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts.

Natasha Romanoff: Can we do that?

Bruce Banner: Not me. Not here.

James Rhodes: You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back.

Steve Rogers: I know somewhere.

[Cut to rural Wakanda, as King T'Challa and Okoye walk together, accompanied by two Kingsguard. Screen title: WAKANDA.]

Okoye: You'll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.

T'Challa: And the Border Tribe?

Okoye: Those that are left.

T'Challa: Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.

Okoye: And what of this one?

T'Challa: This one may be tired of war. [James "Bucky" Buchanan Barnes is seen at a small distance throwing a bag from a pile on the ground onto a partly-filled cart, while two village children watch] But the White Wolf has rested long enough.

[The party reaches Bucky. A Kingsguards-man sets an elaborate and high-tech-looking equipment case down on the cart, opens the lid, and steps back. As the Winter Soldier approaches, he sees a new Vibranium arm in the case.]

Bucky Barnes: [With resignation] Where's the fight?

T'Challa: On its way.

[Cut to Ebony Maw interrogating Dr. Strange. Dr. Strange is floating horizontally, face down, and is surrounded by dozens of glassy needles, each about two feet long.]

Ebony Maw: In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be... judgement. [The needles start to contact Dr. Strange's face, causing an obviously painful whitish subcutaneous glow at each touch] Give me... the stone.

[Cut to Tony who is watching, hidden, from above. The Cloak of Levitation taps Stark on the arm. He raises his hand to it, ready to shoot, but he sees what it is and stands down.]

Tony Stark: Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?

Peter Parker: Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty....

[Tony and the Cloak turn to face Peter, dropping down from above]

Tony Stark: What the--

Peter Parker: I know what you're gonna say.

Tony Stark: You should not be here.

[The Cloak moves to "stand" at Tony's side]

Peter Parker: I was gonna go home--

Tony Stark: I don't wanna hear it.

Peter Parker: But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way...

Tony Stark: And now I gotta hear it.

[The Cloak shakes its collar in sympathy and shrugs]

Peter Parker: ...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.

[The Cloak looks shocked.]

Tony Stark: [Seriously] What did you just say?

Peter Parker: I take that back. And now I'm here in space.

Tony Stark: Yeah. [Tony crosses to stand right in front of Peter] Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's a one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.

Peter Parker: No. I did think this through.

Tony Stark: You could not have possibly thought this through.

Peter Parker: It's just .. you can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood. [He waits for Tony's reaction] Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.

Tony Stark: [Breaths shakily] Come on. We got a situation. [He leads Peter over to a viewpoint on the torture below. Peter crouches to study the situation, the Cloak leaning over his shoulder.] See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.

Peter Parker: Um. Okay, okay... uh... [Peter and the Cloak pop back upright] Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?

[The Cloak lifts its collar in surprise.]

[Cut back to Ebony Maw interrogating Dr. Strange, who groans loudly.]

Ebony Maw: Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...

[At the "thump" behind him, Maw turns to see Iron Man standing there, hand repulsors ready to fire.]

Ebony Maw: ...Could end your friend's life in an instant.

Tony Stark: I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.

Ebony Maw: [Walks slowly towards Iron Man, beckoning very large, very solid metal objects to float behind him] You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.

Tony Stark: Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.

[Iron Man fires a rocket from his shoulder which pierces the side of the ship to Maw's right and begins to suck everything out with depressurization, especially Maw and his large objects. Dr. Strange is pulled loose of his pinnings, loses the needles, but also heads for the hole, helpless to resist. The Cape wraps around his arm and an anchor point, but Dr. Strange's arm slips loose and he keeps going. Spider-Man shoots a web strand at Dr. Strange with one hand and holds onto a piece of the ship with the other. It breaks, sending them both towards space when his Iron-Spider suit's metal arms brace him to keep him from being sucked out. Fortunately, Dr. Strange is still surrounded by the ship's atmosphere making haste to leave.]

Peter Parker: Yes! Wait what are those?!

[Spider-Man crouches with his new spider-legs, and makes a mighty leap to pulls them both back inside. Iron Man quickly sprays nanites onto the hole to plug it up. Dr. Strange safely, if emphatically, hits the floor. Ebony Maw is seen floating in space, quite dead, ice from the escaped atmosphere frosting over his grimace. Spider-Man lands on his new legs, retracts them, and finds the Cape "standing" next to him.]

Peter Parker: Hey, we haven't officially met. [He offers the Cape his hand to shake. It ignores his offer and continues to Dr. Strange.] Cool.

[Iron Man walks past Dr. Strange, shaking his head and with his armor retreating into its containment as Dr. Strange gets to his feet and becomes en-Cloaked.]

Stephen Strange: We've gotta turn this ship around.

Tony Stark: Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.

Stephen Strange: No, I want to protect the stone.

[Tony walks towards the expansive front view-port, showing a hyper speed/warp effect.]

Tony Stark: [Irritably] And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening.

Stephen Strange: For what? Nearly blasting me into space?

Tony Stark: Who just saved your magical ass? Me.

Stephen Strange: I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.

Tony Stark: Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.

Stephen Strange: Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.

Tony Stark: And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.

[Seriously, these two's egos are a recipe for disaster.]

Peter Parker: [Raises his hand] I'm backup.

Tony Stark: No. You're a stowaway. [Waggles a finger between himself and Dr. Strange] The adults are talking.

Stephen Strange: I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. Wh-- what is he, your ward?

Peter Parker: No. I'm Peter, by the way.

Stephen Strange: Dr. Strange.

Peter Parker: Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then.

Tony Stark: This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.

Stephen Strange: [Walks closer to Tony] Can we control it? Fly us home? [Tony is lost in bad memories and does not respond right away.] Stark?

Tony Stark: Yeah?

Stephen Strange: Can you get us home?

Tony Stark: Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking... I'm not so sure we should.

Stephen Strange: Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.

Tony Stark: [Stalks over to Strange] No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?

Stephen Strange: [Pauses] Alright, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it.

Tony Stark: Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight. [Stepping over to Peter, he formally taps each of Peter's shoulders with the edge of his hand, dubbing him as is done at a knighting.] Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now. [He doesn't look at him as he says those words, knowing well what he is signing him up for.]

[Peter looks at Tony in disbelief, and then cycles through delight, satisfaction, pride and determination, and braces himself for what's to come.]

[Cut to Thanos' mother-ship, Sanctuary II, which dwarfs the massive ring-ships the Black Order have been using. Gamora sits near the throne deep inside the ship. Thanos walks up, bringing a cup of food and holds it out to her.]

Thanos: I thought you might be hungry.

[Gamora takes it, then hurls it across the room where it bangs against Thanos' throne with a loud clack.]

Gamora: I always hated that chair.

Thanos: So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.

Gamora: I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.

Thanos: You told me that too. [Thanos mounts two of the four steps to his throne, turns, and sits on the second from the top.] Every day. For almost twenty years.

Gamora: I was a child when you took me.

Thanos: I saved you.

Gamora: No. No. We were happy on my home planet.

Thanos: Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.

Gamora: Because you murdered half the planet.

Thanos: A small price to pay for salvation.

Gamora: You're insane.

Thanos: Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.

Gamora: You don't know that!

Thanos: [Scowls as his egotistical narcissism prevents him from fully listening to her] I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it. [He stands again and walks back to Gamora] For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter.

Gamora: I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.

Thanos: And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.

Gamora: I'm sorry I disappointed you.

Thanos: I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it. [Leans down to put their heads at a level, whispering fiercely] But because you did. [Looks at her] And you lied.

[Thanos and Gamora stand outside a large solid door that slides open vertically as they approach, then pause as a set of inner doors made of interlacing metal slide away. Inside, we see Nebula face-on, suspended horizontally in the air in the middle of the room, her breath shuddering in pain.]

Gamora: Nebula.

[Gamora hurries to to Nebula's left side, and we now see that she has been partially disassembled, her components stretched apart -- a cybernetic version of the medieval torture rack. Hannibal Lecter level of brutality.]

Gamora: Don't do this.

Thanos: Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

Gamora: Please don't do this.

Thanos: And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.

[Thanos curls his gauntleted fist, activating both the Power and Space Stones, scowling -- causing Nebula's already extended pieces to stretch further outward. She begins to scream.]

Gamora: Stop. Stop it. [She puts her hands on the gauntlet, pulling it down] I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.

[Thanos signals a nearby servant who taps on a control pad. We hear Nebula's voice say, "Accessing memory files" and a sort of hologram of Gamora's face shudders to life.]

Memory Nebula: You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them.

Memory Gamora: He can never get them all.

Memory Nebula: He will!

Memory Gamora: He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it.

[The memory ends.]

Thanos: [To Gamora, walking around behind her] You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it. [His voice drips with disgust] Where is the Soul Stone? [He raises his gauntlet next to Gamora's face. Nebula shakes her head, expression terrified, to encourage her sister's silence but when Gamora does not answer, Thanos clenches the gauntlet again, brow furrowed at his adopted daughter as the Power and Space Stones are reactivated. Gamora grimaces in shared pain at her sister's screams, growing louder as Thanos increases the pressure.]

Gamora: Vormir! [Thanos unclenches his hand, and Nebula gasps in air as her parts snap back almost into place. Gamora goes to her and caresses her face.] The Stone is on Vormir.

Thanos: [Satisfied.] Show me.

[Cut to the pod taking Thor, Rocket and Groot to Nidavellir.]

Groot: [Irritably] I am Groot. (Translation: I need to tinkle.)

Rocket: Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.

Groot: [Still irritably] I am Groot. (Translation: But the cup is full.)

Thor: [While looking out the rear portholes] Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.

Rocket: You speak Groot?

Thor: Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.

Groot: [Shortly] I am Groot. (Translation: How long 'till we get there?)

Thor: You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star. [Nostalgically] It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.

[Rocket turns to see Thor sitting sadly beside the window, and sighs.]

Rocket: [To himself] Okay, time to be the captain. [Walks to a console near by Thor, presses two buttons] So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.

Thor: Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true.

Rocket: And you said your sister and your dad?

Thor: Both dead.

Rocket: Still got a mom, though?

Thor: Killed by a dark elf.

Rocket: A best friend?

Thor: Stabbed through the heart.

Rocket: Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?

Thor: [Smiling widely but also trying to convince himself] Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret... they're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go.

Rocket: Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about... he's the toughest there is.

Thor: Well, he's never fought me.

Rocket: Yeah, he has!

Thor: He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.

Rocket: Better be some hammer.

Thor: You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so.

Rocket: And what if you're wrong?

Thor: If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?

[Thor sniffs and hastily wipes below his eye. He stands and seats himself at the front of the pod, beside Groot.]

Rocket: [Under his breath] I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot. [Rocket takes an eyeball from somewhere on his person] Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball. [He gives Thor the eyeball.]

Thor: What's this?

Rocket: What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.

Thor: He gave you his eye?

Rocket: He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.

Thor: Thank you, sweet rabbit.

[Thor proceeds to put the eyeball in his socket. We are thankfully spared the explicit insertion.]

Rocket: Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...[beeping] Hey, we're here!

Thor: [Smacking his palm against the side of his head to get the eye calibrated] I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.

Rocket: It ain't the eye.

[Nidavellir is dark and motionless as the three rings around it.]

Thor: Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.

[The pod flies through massive machinery, cold and inert. Screen title: NIDAVELLIR]

[The pod sets down; Thor, Rocket and Groot disembark and start walking through a seemingly abandoned and cluttered space. Groot is still playing his game.]

Rocket: I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.

Thor: This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries....

Rocket: [Pauses, looking at a pedestal] You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

Thor: Yes. Why?

Rocket: Look anything like that? [In fact, it looks exactly like that]

Groot: [Uneasily] I am Groot.

Thor: [Urgently] Go back to the pod.

[Suddenly a massive figure storms towards them, flinging Thor away with one swing of his arm, and kicking Rocket and Groot against a wall of equipment.]

Thor: Eitri, wait! Stop!

Eitri: Thor?

[Eitri is played by the legendary Peter Dinklage -- his giant size literally juxtaposing his name of dwarf.]

Thor: What happened here?

Eitri: You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!

Thor: Asgard is destroyed. [Thor scrambles to his feet and points. Eitri stop his attack on Thor. He now believes Thanos had destroyed Asgard and leaving him in a similar survivor role like Eitri himself.] Eitri, the glove. What did you do?

Eitri: [He walks brokenly across the space to sit heavily, leaning against an ore skip. Rocket and Groot get to their feet, the sapling checking his game.] 300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. 'Your life is yours,' he said. 'But your hands are mine alone.' [He holds up his immobile metal fists, encased in hardened molten metal.]

Thor: Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've ever designed: every ax, hammer, sword - it's all inside your head. Now I know it feels like all hope is lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.

[Cut to Nebula suspended in the interrogation room seen earlier, while a technician puts her back together. Nebula ejects her eyepiece and snaps the neck of the tech when he comes close enough to replace it. She walks to a console, straightening her left arm, dragging her still-dislocated right foot behind her, and inputs a code.]

Nebula: Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan.

[Cut to Peter Parker, Tony Stark, and Dr. Strange aboard the ship approaching the surface of Titan.]

Peter Parker: [To Tony] Hey, what's going on?

Stephen Strange: I think we're here.

Tony Stark: I don't think this rig has a self-park function. [Urgently] Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?

Peter Parker: Yep, got it.

Tony Stark: This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.

Peter Parker: Okay. Okay. Ready.

[The ringship is heading straight for the center of what looks like one of a colossal game of jacks.]

Peter Parker: We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!!

[Iron Man armors up as the ringship clips the "jack" obliquely, but still losing a good third of its hull in the collision. Spider-Man throws up his helmet at the same time. Doctor Strange steps between them and creates the Shield of the Seraphim around them all, anticipating a rough landing.]

[The ship, now reduced to about 45%, plows through the dirt and stops, leaning slightly to one side. Screen title: TITAN.]

[Doctor Strange helps Tony, now de-helmeted, to his feet; they're both panting a little from the exertion of arrival.]

Tony Stark: [To Doctor Strange] You alright? [Panting] That was close. I owe you one.

[Spider-Man descends from above in classically spider-like fashion.]

Peter Parker: Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

Tony Stark: [While pointing at Peter] I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?

Peter Parker: I'm trying to say that... something is coming.

[A grenade rolls into view, and Peter, Strange and Tony get thrown well back when it fires its energy pulse. Star-Lord, Drax, and Mantis appear in the doorway]

Drax: [Yelling] THANOS!!!! [He flings a blade at Doctor Strange, who neatly deflects it with a mystical shield, and in return sends the Cloak of Levitation at Drax's face, half-smothering him and throwing him to the floor. Star-Lord and Iron Man have a brief dogfight until a magnetic disc pins Iron Man face-first to a structure.]

Peter Parker: [Crawling backwards frantically from an anxious-looking Mantis] AH! Whoawhoawhoawhoa! PLEASE DON'T PUT YOUR EGGS IN ME!

[Spider-Man shoots web at Mantis in a panic, pinning arms to her body just before Star-Lord flies at him feet-first, kicking him away.]

Peter Quill: Stay down, clown!

[Star-Lord can't quite counter spider reflexes at first; he fires at Spider-Man, who extends his spider legs and leaps away, but an electric-like cord wraps around Spider-Man and his six new legs when he tries to attack, sending him rolling across the deck.]

Drax: [Struggling with the Cloak of Levitation] Die, blanket of death!

[Iron Man pulls free of the magnet; the Cloak pulls free of Drax as soon as Iron Man has a bead on his opponent and a foot on his torso.]

[Star-Lord has Spider-Man in a head-lock, gun pointed at the smaller man's head.]

[Doctor Strange has a mystical shield of golden energy up, and stands ready at the third point of the triangle. Mantis has struggled to her feet behind Star-Lord, still covered with webbing.]

Peter Quill: Alright, everybody, stay where you are... chill the F out. [Star-Lord powers off his helmet] I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?

Tony Stark: [De-helmeting] Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?

Drax: I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora?

Peter Quill: Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French-fry this little freak.

Tony Stark: Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go! [Tony extends his nano-tech cannon, looking uncannily like an electric shark about to eat Drax's face.]

Drax: Do it, Quill! I can take it.

Mantis: No, he can't take it!

Stephen Strange: [Completely deadpan] She's right. You can't.

Peter Quill: Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself. [To Spider-Man] Starting with you.

Stephen Strange: Wait, what. Thanos? [Trying to inject clarity and sanity into the situation] Alright, let me ask you this one time: What master do you serve?

Peter Quill: What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? "Jesus"?

Tony Stark: [Getting it] You're from Earth?

Peter Quill: I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.

Tony Stark: Yeah, that's on Earth, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?

Peter Parker: [Sounding slightly crushed] So, you're not with Thanos?

Peter Quill: [Indignantly] With Thanos?! No, I'm here to kill Thanos! He took my girl- Wai- who are you?

Peter Parker: [De-helmets] We're the Avengers, man.

Peter Quill: Oh.

Mantis: You're the ones Thor told us about!

Tony Stark: You know Thor!?

Peter Quill: Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking, [Peter gives him an incredulous look] needed saving.

Doctor Strange: [Pause] Where is he now?

[Cut to Nivadellir where Eitri is showing Thor, Rocket, and Groot the mold for Stormbreaker.]

Rocket: This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?

Eitri: It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.

Thor: Did it have a name?

Eitri: Stormbreaker.

Rocket: That's a bit much.

Thor: So how do we make it?

Eitri: You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.

Thor: Rabbit, fire up the pod.

[Cut to Titan where the remaining Avengers and the Guardians are starting to work together. Quill is measuring the planet's tilt.]

Peter Quill: The heck happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.

[in the background, Mantis is jumping joyfully in a low gravity spot.]

Tony Stark: Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet.

[Drax yawns.]

Tony Stark: Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?

Drax: I stopped listening after you said, "We need a plan."

Tony Stark: [To Quill] Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

Peter Quill: See, "not winging it" isn't really what they do.

Peter Parker: Uh, what exactly is it that they do?

Mantis: [As fiercely as an 8-week-old kitten] Kick names, take ass.

Drax: Yeah, that's right. [Agrees quietly as he settles into a stance facing the remaining Avengers.]

Tony Stark: [Tony pauses with an expression of deep hopelessness] Alright, just get over here, please. Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?

Peter Quill: "Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine. [Motions to Drax and Mantis,]

Tony Stark: We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude....

Peter Quill: Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good. [Peter Parker follows the conversation back and forth like a squash rally.]

Drax: Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.

Tony Stark: What dance-off?

Peter Quill: It's not a... it's not... it's nothing.

Peter Parker: Like in Footloose, the movie?

Peter Quill: [Excitedly] Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?

Peter Parker: It never was.

[Quill frowns sadly at him.]

Tony Stark: Don't encourage this, alright?

Peter Parker: Okay.

Tony Stark: We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.

Peter Quill: Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human. [Quill points at Stark and Parker] So that 50% of me that's stupid? That's 100% you.

Tony Stark: Your math is blowing my mind.

Mantis: Excuse me, but... does your friend often do that?

[Dr. Strange is sitting cross-legged, floating slightly above the ground, his hands poised in a mystic gesture with the Time Stone glowing brightly in the Eye of Agamotto setting. Green vapor-like energy flows from the stone, and more intricate magical energy patterns circle Dr. Strange's forearms. The Cloak of Levitation flows behind him as if the Stone is creating a strong breeze. His eyes are closed, and his head is jerking rapidly from side to side, the motion blurring, but resembling looking for something.]

Tony Stark: Strange, we alright?

[Dr. Strange snaps out of his trance and falls forward, letting out a cry.]

Tony Stark: You're back. You're alright.

Peter Parker: Hey, what was that?

Stephen Strange: [Panting] I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.

Peter Quill: How many did you see?

Stephen Strange:14,000,605.

Tony Stark: How many did we win?

[Dr. Strange stares intently at Tony for a moment.]

Stephen Strange: [Pause] One.

[Cut to Thanos and Gamora appearing on sand dunes alternating with shallow pools around the base of a mountain. The sun is in full eclipse, lending eerie lighting to the scene. Screen title: VORMIR]

Thanos: The stone had better be up there... for your sister's sake.

[The walk up the mountain seems to be long, but not difficult. Paths worn by centuries or more of feet lead up to the summit, where Thanos and Gamora encounter a floating hooded figure].

Stonekeeper: Welcome, Thanos, son of A'lars. Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

Thanos: You know us?

Stonekeeper: It is my curse to know all who journey here.

Thanos: Where's the Soul Stone?

Stonekeeper: You should know... it extracts a terrible price.

Thanos: I am prepared.

Stonekeeper: We all think that at first. [The figure touches down and glides out of the shadows, revealing the face of who we know to be Johann "The Red Skull" Schmidt from Captain America: The First Avenger.] We are all wrong.

[The Stonekeeper guides them to a temple-like structure at the summit.]

Thanos: How is it you know this place so well?

Red Skull: A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.

[They stop on a semicircular engraving overlooking a sheer drop. It descends in three shallow steps to a final half-circle cutout, the whole bisected by a deep cut that runs between the two spires behind them. Far, far below is a full circle with similar engraved decoration.]

Red Skull: What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.

Thanos: What's this?

Red Skull: The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.

Thanos: Tell me what it needs.

Red Skull: To ensure that whoever possesses it... understands its power.... The stone demands a sacrifice.

Thanos: Of what?

Red Skull: In order to take the stone, you must lose that which you love. A soul, for a soul.

[Gamora begins to laugh at the irony of the situation.]

Gamora: All my life, I dreamed of a day... a moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now... you kill and torture... and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one.

Thanos: [Turns to face Gamora with tears in his eyes.]

Gamora: Really? Tears?

Red Skull: They're not for him.

[Gamora looks at the Red Skull, and as her bitter smile fades, realizes what is about to happen, as do we.... ]

Gamora: No! This isn't love!

Thanos: [Thoroughly convicted.] I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you. [Gamora stares down unseeing for a moment, then up at the resolution on his face. She grabs the red-jeweled dagger from his belt with lightning reflexes, triggers the blades and stabs herself in the stomach... except it's only bubbles.] I'm sorry, little one. [He grabs Gamora by the arm and walks inexorably to the precipice.]

Gamora: No!

[She tries in vain to break from his grasp, much like she tried to pull free from the Child of Thanos so many years ago, but, pain showing clearly on his face, he throws her over the edge, and watches sorrowfully as she falls to her death. Light pulses overhead as the sacrifice is correctly accomplished.]

[Thanos finds himself lying in one of the shallow pools back at the base of the mountain. He opens his hand and sees that he now has the orange Soul Stone.]

[Cut to the Quinjet where Sam is piloting Rhodey, Steve, Natasha, Wanda, and Vision.]

Steve Rogers: [Walking up to the pilot's seat] Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

Sam Wilson: I hope you're right about this, Cap. Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.

[The Quinjet passes through a camouflage force field into Wakanda's Golden City's valley and lands at the airfield outside the palace. King T'Challa and the Dora Milaje approach to greet the arrivals]

Okoye: [Walking with King T'Challa and a band of the Kingsguard to the landing pad] When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world... this is not what I imagined.

T'Challa: And what did you imagine?

Okoye: The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.

[The occupants of the Quinjet disembark, Steve and Natasha leading, followed by Bruce and Rhodey, with Vision and Wanda slowly taking up the rear.]

Bruce Banner: [To Rhodey] Should we bow?

James Rhodes: [Seriously] Yeah, he's a king.

Steve Rogers: Seems like I'm always thanking you for something. [Shaking hands with King T'Challa.]

[Bruce bows awkwardly to King T'Challa.]

James Rhodes: [Mock shocked] What are you doing?

T'Challa: Uh, we don't do that here. [He dissuades Bruce with a motion of his hand; Bruce shoots Rhodey a look, and is answered with a big grin] So how big of an assault can we expect?

[The group begins to walk back into the administrative building.]

Bruce Banner: Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault.

Natasha Romanoff: How we looking?

King T'Challa: You will have my Kingsguard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...

Bucky Barnes: [Smiling as he walks toward Steve, passing some Kingsguard taking Vision and Wanda to another facility] A semi-stable, 100-year-old man.

[The two friends share a hug.]

Steve Rogers: How you been, Buck?

Bucky Barnes: Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.

[In Shuri's lab, Shuri scans the Stone with her kimoyo beads while Vision lies on the examination table. She flips her hand over and studies the hologram projected over her palm.]

Shuri: Whoa. The structure is polymorphic.

Bruce Banner: Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.

Shuri: Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?

[Vision looks at Bruce as if to ask the same thing.]

Bruce Banner: [Uncertainly] Because, we didn't think of it.

Shuri: [Reassuringly, with a smile] I'm sure you did your best.

Wanda Maximoff: Can you do it?

Shuri: Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures. [To King T'Challa] It will take time, brother.

Steve Rogers: How long?

Shuri: As long as you can give me.

Okoye: [Her kimoyo beads chime an alarm; she flicks one bead into her palm, where it projects the globe with a pulsing location marker] Something's entered the atmosphere.

[Outside, Sam and Bucky look up at the sky]

Sam Wilson: [Over the Avengers' comm] Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.

[The defense shield over the Golden City destroys one of the alien vessels when it slams into the field at full attack acceleration.]

Bucky Barnes: God, I love this place.

James Rhodes: [also outside, and now in full War Machine armor watching three more ships burn through the sky] Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome.

[The shock waves and debris from the ship landings destroy acres of forest and boil up against the dome. The lab has an excellent view of the landing sites. Captain America and Black Panther look at each other in concern over the scope of what they'll be facing.]

Vision: [Struggling to sit up and slide off the exam table] It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now.

Natasha Romanoff: [Moving toward Vision] Vision, get your ass back on the table.

T'Challa: We will hold them off. [He, Okoye and the guards head for the door.]

Steve Rogers: [To Wanda] Wanda, as soon as the stone's out of his head... you blow it to hell.

Wanda Maximoff: I will.

T'Challa: Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures. [He stops, turns, and points at Steve] And get this man a shield.

[Cut to Nivadellir where Rocket is in the pod, and Thor, without any environmental suit, jumps from the hull onto the ring surface with a cable in his hand attached to the pod.]

Rocket: I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving, you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.

Thor: Leave that to me.

Rocket: Leave that to you? Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a--

Thor: [Thor begins to swing the pod around him in a circle. Rocket screams. Thor builds up speed with three good loops then slacks his grip enough to send the pod shooting straight away from Nidavellir, trailing him behind it like a kite tail.] Fire the engines!

Rocket: [Rocket shakes it off and puts the proverbial pedal to the metal.] Nnnyah!

Thor: [As the pod skims over the surface of the next ring out, Thor reaches down and digs one hand into the surface, then both feet, finally getting a foothold against the forward motion of the pod. The ice-like accumulation around the ring axis crackles.] MORE... POWER... RABBIT!

[Thor commits bicep porn while Rocket accelerates for all he's worth. Finally the rings spin free, realigning into effective configuration as the star bursts back into life.]

Eitri: Well done, boy.

[Thor, clutching the pod's forward windows, points to the star.]

Thor: That's Nivadellir!

[Rocket gazes amazed at the blazing core. An iris on the cladding around the star opens, firing pure stellar heat through the ring portals and into the forge... until the damaged mechanism fails, crumbles loose and slams shut. The iris closes and the beam of light trails off.]

Eitri: Damn it.

Rocket: "Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

Eitri: The mechanism is crippled.

Thor: What?

Eitri: With the iris closed I can't heat the metal.

Thor: How long will it take to heat?

Eitri: A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

Thor: [Standing up on the pod hull] I'm gonna hold it open.

Eitri: That's suicide.

Thor: So is facing Thanos without that ax. [He leaps from the pod to the star's iris.]

[Cut to the Wakandan battlefield. Carriers hover over the ground with Wakandan soldiers and Natasha, Steve and Bucky on board; Rhodey and Sam keep pace overhead, and Bruce is in the Hulkbuster armor.]

Natasha Romanoff: How we looking, Bruce?

Bruce Banner: [Leaping jogging along, keeping up with the carriers, and utterly delighted] Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Wow! It's like being the Hulk without actually-- [he stumbles on a rock, and a carrier goes by, from which Okoye gives him a dubious look. He stands] I'm okay. I'm okay.

James Rhodes: I got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.

[The heat signatures are Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian.]

[The carrier pilots swerve into U-turns, causing their craft to tilt and allowing the practiced soldiers to slide over one side into a run, never coming to a complete halt. A Dora Milaje shouts a command nearby as the last Wakandans join ranks.]

Jabari Warriors: MIE EFFA! (Win them!) YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! [M'Baku, Lord of the Jabari, rallies his soldiers with a war chant. He stops as King T'Challa nears him.]

T'Challa: [Clasps wrists with M'Baku] Thank you for standing with us.

M'Baku: [Translated from Xhosa] Of course, brother.

[The Black Panther, Captain America, and Black Widow walk to the edge of the barrier, where Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian stand. Proxima tests the strength of the barrier by drawing her sword across it consideringly.]

Natasha Romanoff: Where's your other friend?

Proxima Midnight: You will pay for his life with yours. Thanos will have that stone.

Steve Rogers: That's not gonna happen.

T'Challa: You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.

Proxima Midnight: We... have blood to spare. [She brandishes her sword with a snarl, and the ships behind her start raising their outer hulls to allow their "passengers" to disembark.]

[The three heroes return to the massed forces.]

Bucky Barnes: [A touch sardonically] Did they surrender?

Steve Rogers: Not exactly.

[The Black Panther leads the Wakandans in the war cry "Yibambe!" telling them to hold fast as the Outriders bound toward the barrier; Proxima drops her sword arm down in the signal to attack.]

Bucky Barnes: [Flatly, astonished at the numbers of Outriders] What the hell.

Natasha Romanoff: Looks like we pissed her off.

Okoye: [Horrified, as the Outriders bombard the force-field, squeezing limbs and bodies partly through only to be bisected.] They're killing themselves.

[As a few Outriders managed to squeeze through intact, the Border Tribe take a knee and raise their shields. The Kingsguard behind them level their sonic spears over their comrades' shoulders, and on Black Panther's command, fire at the approaching monsters. The Winter Soldier uses his M-249 machine gun, and Bruce fires the Hulkbuster's hand repulsors.]

Sam Wilson: [Sending Redwings into the fight as he flies, swooping to fire at them with his Steyr pistols] You seen the teeth on those things?

James Rhodes: Alright, back up, Sam. You're gonna get your wings singed. [He flies over the heaviest concentration of Outriders and drops a barrage of mines, all exploding fantastically.]

[Everyone notices a pack of Outriders starting to run around the force-field to the right of the defenders' position.]

Bruce Banner: Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us... there's nothing between them and Vision.

Steve Rogers: [Grimly] Them we better keep 'em in front of us.

Okoye: [To the Black Panther] How do we do that?

T'Challa: We open the barrier. [Putting his comm to his mouth] On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.

Dome Control: [Nervous and unsure] Requesting confirmation, my King. You said open the barrier?

T'Challa: On my signal.

M'Baku: [To Okoye] This will be the end of Wakanda.

Okoye: Then it will be the noblest ending in history.

[Captain America readies one of his Vibranium hand guards. The Black Panther shouts a command in Xhosa; the Border Tribesmen disengage their shields and stand, as the Black Panther walks out in front of them, never taking his eyes off the enemy.]

T'Challa: WAKANDA FOREVER!!!! [He crosses his arms in the Wakandan salute and closes his Black Panther helmet, charging for the barrier. The heroes and leaders are at the fore of the charge. Halfway to the barrier, the Black Panther shouts into his comm] Now!

[The Outriders pour through, distracted from trying to find any other access. The Black Panther and Captain America pull ahead rapidly due to their enhancements, and literally leap into battle.]

T'Challa: [Over his comm] How much longer, Shuri?

Shuri: We've barely begun, brother. [A delicate and intricate construction of gold light hovers at her eye level; as she manipulates it, the waldo tools reproduce her commands on the Mind Stone itself.]

T'Challa: You might want to pick up the pace.

[Simultaneously, Thor prepares to open the iris of Nidavellir.]

Thor: Allfathers, give me strength.

Eitri: You understand, boy? You're about to take the full force of a star. It'll kill you.

Thor: Only if I die. [Takes deep breaths.]

Eitri: [Boggled] Yes. That's what... "killing you" means.

[Thor grasps the two levers and pulls them down and towards himself, slowly opening the iris. The stream of stellar energy blasts pasts him and into the forge once again.]

Eitri: Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

[Eitri watches the metal ingots melt while Thor is looking increasingly charred. Finally, Eitri is able to tip the cauldron, pouring the metal into the mold just as Thor passes out. The jet carries him into the forge, Rocket follows hastily and landing after Thor bounces limply off a structure to land on the floor. Groot finally looks up from his game at the thump Thor's body makes.]

Rocket: [Kneeling over Thor] Thor! Say something. Come on. Thor, you okay? [Thor looks far from "okay".]

[Eitri clumsily and urgently pulls the mold, still glowing red-hot, onto the floor, breaking it loose from its frame, then starts punching the mold itself with his metal fists to free the ax.]

Rocket: I think he's dying!

Eitri: He needs the ax! Where's the handle? Tree, help me find the handle!

[Stormbreaker's two sections -- the hammer and the ax-blade -- lay glowing on the floor. Groot looks sadly at Thor, then scowls with determination. He stands, and extends his fingers towards Stormbreaker, growing them at extraordinary speed. As he twines them around the two parts, he cries out at the burning pain but does not hesitate, slamming them together and locking them permanently into one structure. He raises it above his head, and with a mighty cry, chops his extended arm with his other hand to sever it at the right length.Thor's fingers twitch, and the new weapon levitates in a crackle of lightning echoed by the sparks between Thor's fingers.]

[The remaining Avengers and Wakandans are struggling against the Outriders. The Winter Soldier goes down, and fights off Outrider fangs snapping at his head. Captain America and the Black Panther still fight side-by-side. War Machine hovers over the breach, pouring ammunition into the flood of bodies until a huge hammer -- Cull Obsidian's -- knocks him out of the sky and to the ground. The Hulkbuster is dogpiled and pinned.]

Bruce Banner: There’s too many of them! GYAH! AAAAHHHHH!

[Suddenly, a large beam of rainbow-hued light lands in the middle of the action, and an ax flies out of it, wreathed with lightning and tearing through the Outriders, freeing the heroes. It flies back to the light and into its master's hand just as the beam cuts out, revealing Thor, Groot and Rocket [The Avengers theme swelling triumphantly at their arrival] who chambers a round in his large gun. Black Widow, Captain America and the Black Panther pause in astonishment. Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian pause in apprehension.]

Bruce Banner: [Opening the Hulkbuster's helm and laughing with joy] AH-hahaha! You guys are so screwed now!

Thor: BRING ME THANOS! [He charges toward the hordes of Outriders, followed by Groot and Rocket, lightning gathering around him until he finally launches himself into the air, lands in the densest concentration of Outriders and makes a crater where they had stood.]

[Cut to Titan, where Thanos arrives, finding only fresh debris from Ebony Maw's ship.]

Stephen Strange: [Sitting on what may have been plaza steps once] Oh, yeah, you're much more of a "Thanos."

Thanos: I take it the Maw is dead. This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission.

Stephen Strange: You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.

Thanos: And where do you think he brought you? [Star-Lord crouches behind wreckage with his weapon ready, behind Thanos and to his left; Spider-Man peeks from above and behind Doctor Strange.]

Stephen Strange: Let me guess. Your home?

Thanos: [Smiling reminiscently] It was. And it was beautiful. [Thanos curls his gauntleted fist and activates the Reality Stone to show Strange Titan before it was destroyed -- green lawns, intact buildings, water-filled ponds, strolling citizens, the jack-like structures hovering and connected to the ground-based buildings with beams of energy.] Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.

Stephen Strange: Genocide.

Thanos: But at random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass. [He relaxes his fist; the Stone stops glowing and the illusion fades back into the true state of Titan.]

Stephen Strange: [Sarcastically] Congratulations. You're a prophet.

Thanos: I'm a survivor.

Stephen Strange: Who wants to murder trillions.

Thanos: With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist. I call that... mercy.

Stephen Strange: [Stands] And then what?

Thanos: I finally rest... and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

Stephen Strange: [He summons his Mandalas, entering a fighting pose] I think... you'll find... our will... equal to yours.

Thanos: Ours? [He looks up to a see a chunk of wreckage descending rapidly on him, too rapidly to react -- and powered by Iron Man. He is subsequently crushed by it.]

Tony Stark: [Flying in] Piece of cake, Quill.

Peter Quill: [Triggers his mask and follows] Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!

[The wreckage on top of Thanos erupts in purple, as he bellows in rage. He turns the hovering fragments into a flock of bats with the Reality Stone and swarms Iron Man with them, driving him back through the ruins.]

[Spider-Man webs his eyes, and swings in to kick him in the face at the same time that Drax leaps from cover, blades in both hands, to knee-slide behind Thanos and try for a tendon slide across the back of the Titan's knee.]

[Doctor Strange jumps through a portal and summons a sword of golden energy, dueling with Thanos while Drax attacks similarly on his other side. Thanos punches Drax through a ruined wall, then shatters the blade with one hand and tears the web from his eyes. He advances on Doctor Strange and kicks at him, but Strange's shield absorbs the damage -- the Cloak lifts him free of the ground.]

[Star-Lord has been making his way back on the ground, and shoots Thanos from behind. Thanos uses the Power Stone to shoot balls of energy at Star-Lord while Star-Lord leaps towards Thanos using magical platforms thrown in his path by Doctor Strange, the last one placed above Thanos' head so Star-Lord can flip over him and slap a mine on Thanos' back. Star-Lord sticks his landing, he disengages his helmet, flips Thanos a bird and falls backward into a portal.]

Peter Quill: Boom!

[The explosion knocks Thanos to his knees and dazes him briefly.]

Stephen Strange: [Whispers to the Cloak of Levitation] Do not let him close his fist. [The Cloak swoops off Doctor Strange's shoulders and wraps itself tightly around Thanos' armored hand, who starts tugging at this unexpected wrapping.]

[Doctor Strange starts throwing portals everywhere. Spider-Man leaps through one on Thanos' left]

Peter Parker: Magic! [He punches Thanos in the head and vanishes through a portal to the lower right before reappearing above Thanos] More magic! [He yanks Thanos' head down hard, then leaps into a portal in front of him. He leaps through another portal high and behind Thanos] Magic with a kick! [Delivers a flying kick and falls feet-first into an exit, then appears on his right] Magic with a--

[Before he can finish Thanos turns, grabbing him from the air, and throwing him to the ground, with his hand around his neck.]

Thanos: Insect!

[He then throws him at Doctor Strange, knocking them both down. Thanos finally tears the Cloak away and is then promptly surrounded by fiery explosions as Iron Man bombards him. He sucks all the flame into the gauntlet with the Power Stone and fires it in a stream at Iron Man, hitting him dead on and sending him far away, plowing through a massive fallen machine.]

[Spider-Man leaps from behind, more conventionally this time, while Thanos concentrates his fire on Iron Man, webs the gauntlet and drops down in front of him, pulling hard -- but Thanos yanks on the web-line, pulling the much lighter teenager towards him, and punching him on his way past. He tears the webbing free of the gauntlet just in time for a small spaceship to attempt to crash-land on him.]

[The ship drags Thanos along for a distance, burying him under debris. He stands just as the pilot leaps in a great arc to punch him, landing in front of him with an energy-blade at the ready.]

Thanos: Well, well.

Nebula: You should have killed me.

Thanos: It would've been a waste of parts!

Nebula: [She runs at Thanos, attacking him with her sword] Where's Gamora?!

[Thanos punches her away. Doctor Strange uses the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak to pinion the gauntlet, pulling Thanos' fingers open and trying to pry the gauntlet off his hand.]

[Thanos tries to pull free, as Drax slides in from his right, kicking his knee and knocking him off-balance, then wrapping himself around Thanos' kneeling leg.]

[Star-Lord shoots a electric trap onto the ground to Thanos' right, the tangle-field holding down his unarmored hand.]

[Spider-Man swings in, webs Thanos' chest then wraps it around behind him, digging his Iron Spider legs into the ground to anchor himself.]

[Doctor Strange opens a portal straight above Thanos' out of which drops Mantis, landing on the Titan's shoulders, her hands on his temples. He bellows as she tries to put him under.]

[Iron Man, having returned, is pulling on the gauntlet. Doctor Strange reapplies the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak to reinforce the trap's hold on Thanos' right hand, and the Cloak helps him pull. Thanos is finally subdued enough to incapacitate, not fully asleep.]

Tony Stark: [While pulling] Is he under? Don't let up.

Mantis: [Starting to cry] Be quick. He is very strong.

Tony Stark: Parker, help! Get over here. [Spider-Man drops his web-line, and hurries to help Tony with the gauntlet] She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

Peter Quill: [Flies over to join the others, stands in front of Thanos, tauntingly] I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora?

Thanos: My Gamora...?

Peter Quill: No, bull-shit. Where is she?

Mantis: [Shocked] He is in anguish.

Peter Quill: Good.

Mantis: [Crying] He… he mourns.

Drax: What does this monster have to mourn?

Nebula: Gamora.

Peter Quill: [Pause] What?

Nebula: [Realizing with horror and sadness what has happened] He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone... but she didn't.

Tony Stark: [Frasps the danger immediately and de-helmets] Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, you understand?

[Quill slowly turns to Thanos,]

Tony Stark: [Shouting his pleads desperately] Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off!

Peter Quill: Tell me she's lying. [Enraged] Asshole! Tell me you didn't do it!

Thanos: I... had... to.

Peter Quill: [While starting to tear up; quietly] No, you didn't…! No, you didn't…! [He continues to rage and then pistol-whipping Thanos twice in the face, causing Mantis to let go in pain.] NO, YOU DIDN'T!

Tony Stark: Quill!

[Iron Man leaps for Star-Lord's arm, re-helmeting and leaving Spider-Man to pull off the gauntlet.]

Tony Stark: [To the struggling Star-Lord] Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!

Peter Parker: It's coming! It's coming! It's coming! [Getting the fingers completely loose] I got it! I got it.... !

[Thanos wakes completely, now well and truly furious. He head-butts Mantis, grabbing the cuff of the gauntlet just as it is sliding off his hand, causing Spider-Man to stumble back, and then throwing Mantis away off his shoulders.]

Peter Parker: [Seeing Mantis with far too much air under her] Oh, God. [He jumps and wraps his arms and legs around her, extending his spider legs to form a roll cage for a safe landing.]

[Thanos kicks Drax off his right leg and into Nebula and Star-Lord, knocking them down. He yanks on the Crimson Bands holding his right hand to throw Doctor Strange far away, and swats away Iron Man and his repulsor shots. The remaining Guardians jump up and charge him again, but he fires a pulse of indigo energy at them that knocks the three of them completely unconscious.]

[Iron Man zooms back in, his nanite arm cannon manifested, and is head-butted to the ground. Thanos looks at him for a beat, then raises the gauntlet towards Titan's moon. Iron Man stares, aghast. Thanos uses a combination of the Power and Space Stones to shatter the moon's surface, then bring the debris down on the field of battle at speed. Iron Man powers out of the way but is caught by a chunk of moon about the size of a baseball field, slamming him into the ground. The Guardians go sailing into the air from the rebound.]

[Back in Wakanda, Shuri is working steadily to complete the Mind Stone's removal; Wanda stands by tensely]

[The Kingsguard, Borderers and Jabari have little success going against Cull Obsidian's chained hammer -- he either sends them flying or punches them into the ground. The Black Panther gets free of his other sorties, leaps and uses all his collected kinetic energy behind a punch that lays Obsidian flat.]

Rocket: [Having found a clear spot] Come and get some, space dogs! [Another wave of Outriders heads right for the raccoon-oid. The Winter Soldier, having come up behind Rocket, grabs him with his mechanical arm, holds him at arms length and spins 540 degrees, firing his own M-249 at the same time.] Come on, get some, get some! Come on, get some! [The Winter Soldier drops Rocket, who looks up at him with an impressed gleam] How much for the gun?

Bucky Barnes: [Snaps off another burst] Not for sale.

Rocket: Okay, how much for the arm? [The Winter Soldier just gives him a look and moves off] Oh, I'll get that arm.

[The tides of battle cause Thor, using Stormbreaker to great effect, and Captain America together. They take a breather.]

Steve Rogers: [Panting] New haircut?

Thor: [Grinning] Notice you've copied my beard.

[Captain America nods, wearily gesturing at his own face with a shield-covered hand. Groot skewers three Outriders with his right arm.]

Thor: By the way, this is a friend of mine. Tree. [Gestures towards Groot with Stormbreaker]

Groot: [In full battle snarl] I AM GROOT! (Translation: You gonna help me or what?!)

Steve Rogers: [Formally, but bemused] I am Steve Rogers.

[In Shuri's lab, a deep rumbling can be heard even at their height. Wanda looks down on the battlefield, and sees movement through the blazing forest between the troopships and the dome. When the disturbance reaches the edge of the trees, it turns into vast moving mounds of earth that easily bypass the force field and emerge -- Threshers, sets of massive, motorized spiked wheels, intended for nothing more than shredding everything in their paths.]

T'Challa: Fall back! Fall back now!

[Wanda watches as at least one set of Threshers separates into individual wheels and starts veering all over the battlefield, and then looks anxiously back at Vision]

James Rhodes: Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.

Sam Wilson: I'm doing it. [The two fliers use their firepower to crack a Thresher but cannot find a weak spot.]

[Black Widow with her escrima sticks and Okoye with her augmented spear have drifted together when they're suddenly in the path of a Thresher. Both women cringe at their seemingly inevitable shredding when the Scarlet Witch lands in front of both of them, eyes glowing red, lifting the whole Thresher well clear of the ground. Looking behind her, the friendly forces have scattered and replaced by a charging mob of Outriders -- the perfect place to throw a Thresher. Black Widow straightens with a pleased smile, Okoye with an amazed look.]

Okoye: [A touch indignant] Why was she up there all this time?

[The Children of Thanos help answer that question.]

Proxima Midnight: She's on the field. Take it.

[Corvus Glaive kills one of the guards just outside the lab, alerting Shuri to the problem. She starts hastily disconnecting her equipment from Vision's systems; he gasps at the sensations. The Dora Milaje engages Glaive but is sent skidding across the floor. Shuri finishes her shutdown, grabs one of her sonic panther-paws and fires at Glaive. The Dora attacks again, and Glaive sends both her and Shuri through the balcony railing and onto the main lab floor.]

[Vision is not where Corvus Glaive expects to find him. Vision is, in fact, charging at him and knocking him out the window to fall many meters down the face of Mount Bashenga.]

Sam Wilson: Guys, we got a Vision situation here. [He's tackled by a leaping Outrider and grounded.]

Steve Rogers: Somebody get to Vision!

Bruce Banner: I got him! [Bruce has figured out the Hulkbusters repulsor thrusters and makes a beeline for the android.]

Wanda Maximoff: On my way. [She is clobbered by Proxima Midnight's pommel and rolls down into the large ditch from the Thresher before she can move.]

Proxima Midnight: [Jumping down next to the Scarlet Witch] He'll die alone. As will you.

Natasha Romanoff: She's not alone.

[Okoye silently brandishes her spear on the other side of Proxima and nods at Black Widow.]

Proxima Midnight: Euuyaaah! [She leaps for Black Widow, who has joined her sticks into a full staff. She blocks Proxima's blow with an electrical crackle while Okoye runs around the slope to also attack from the front.]

[Corvus Glaive kicks Vision, knocking him down; as he attempts to rise again, Cull Obsidian shows up and swings his hammer in a full arc, throwing Vision even further. He painfully starts to climb to his feet again when a whooshing overhead interrupts the fight as Bruce Banner lands the Hulkbuster between the aliens and the android. He takes a defensive stance, pointing one hand's repulsor at each.]

Bruce Banner: Oh no, oh no you don't. This isn't going to be like New York, pal. This suit's already kicked the crap out of the Hulk-- [Cull Obsidian jumps forward, grabs Bruce's right arm and Bruce in reflex grabs Obsidian's hammer; a jet fires, taking the two of them in a random direction, to the base of a waterfall.]

Bruce Banner: Guys! Vision needs backup now! [Obsidian pulls the Hulkbuster up and kicks it in the small of the back.] [Trying to change into the Hulk while fighting Cull Obsidian in the Hulkbuster armor] Hulk. Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second. [Bruce extends his left hand protectively; Obsidian grabs the armor's hand, chops the shoulder joint with a relatively small axe then does a roll over Bruce's back to leverage snapping off the Hulkbuster's whole arm] Ahhhhh! Hulk! Hulk! HULK!

Hulk: [Banner's face briefly becomes the Hulk] NOOOO!!!

Bruce Banner: Oh, screw you, ya big green asshole! I'll do it myself! [To Obsidian] Come on!

[He charges the alien, jumps into the air and delivers an effective punch with his remaining hand -- swat, punch, hammer -- except that blow is caught by Obsidian, who punches back, knocking Bruce flat. Obsidian changes his left hand armor into a pointed weapon, and lunges forward to deliver a likely fatal blow, when Bruce grabs the detached Hulkbuster arm out of the water, holding it so Obsidian impales that instead, and slaps the controls.]

Bruce Banner: See you later, Alligator! [The repulsors fire, taking Cull Obsidian high into the air -- high enough, in fact, to intersect the defense dome. The Hulkbuster arm drags Obsidian against the field to grotesque destructive effect, ending in a very final explosion.] Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.

[Proxima Midnight alternates heavy blows between her two opponents, but all three of them duck as a single-wheel Thresher tears overhead, the ditch sparing them most of the danger from the wheel-blades. Proxima uses the distraction to kick Black Widow in the face, sending her to the ground. She then grabs Okoye by the shoulder and weapon and throws her meters away.]

[Simultaneously, Corvus Glaive and Vision struggle in the forest at the foot of Mount Bashenga. Glaive grasps Vision's shoulder and uses the leverage to plunge his blade once more into the android's chest.]

Corvus Glaive: I thought you were formidable, machine. But you're dying, like any man. [He yanks his blade out, and Vision collapses. As he bends over his fallen opponent to retrieve the Stone, he's tackled by Captain America at full speed.]

Steve Rogers: Get outta here! [He exchanges blows with Glaive, using his arm-shields as offence as well as defense, then turns to Vision again] GO!

[Black Widow splits her staff back into a pair of sticks to block Proxima Midnight's sword blows, and finally knocks it from her hand. The alien takes to her bare fists instead, knocks down and pins the Black Widow. Proxima triggers an arm-blade from her left-arm armor, and stabs at Black Widow, who barely manages to block the blade with her crossed sticks. As the edge starts to dig into Black Widow's neck anyway, scarlet energy grabs the alien and tosses her into the air right into the path of another passing Thresher. Dark blue blood spatters the women below. The Scarlet Witch sits up, sighing with relief, her hands still shimmering.]

Natasha Romanoff: That was really gross.

[Captain America keeps blocking Corvus Glaive's staff weapon using his shields, finally knocking it from the alien's hands just before he's thrown over a fallen tree and pinned, Glaive's hand at his throat. Even with his physical abilities, Captain America's struggling -- until a glaive-blade pierces Glaive's chest, and is pushed all the way through. Vision raises his enemy in a perfect mirror of the first attack on him, and holds him for a moment, before dropping Glaive's corpse to one side and collapsing exhaustively.]

Steve Rogers: [helping him back up] I thought I told you to go.

Vision: We don't trade lives, Captain.

[The remaining Guardians and Avengers are dealing with the gravitic aftermath of dumping a large chunk of moon onto an unstable planet's surface. The unconscious Guardians are flying upwards uncontrollably, moon-chunks are still making fiery ballistic in-bounds, and random debris and massive rocks are floating in any possible direction. Spider-Man is well-equipped to handle this physically, even if he's freaking out emotionally.]

Peter Parker: [Webs Mantis] I got you! I got you! [Snags Drax, securing both of them to something not moving] I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names! [Reels in Star-Lord]

[The Cloak of Levitation sets Doctor Strange down on a relatively stable outcrop as Thanos extricates himself from rubble. The Sorcerer Supreme makes a few passes with his hands, producing the familiar golden magic filigree circles, and slams his hands down on the rock before him, invoking the Seven Suns of Cinnibus as a lightning-like effect of immense heat jumping from rock to rock until it reaches Thanos, sending him flying -- but he makes use of the erratic gravity to keep control and fire back a blast from the Power Stone.]

[Doctor Strange blocks the purple plume with a wall of Mirror Dimension, which he then pushes back at Thanos. It shatters around the Titan, who suctions the magic into a miniature black hole with the Space Stone, volleying it back at Doctor Strange. Just in time, Doctor Strange raises a shield and changes the dark energy into a swarm of aqua butterflies which return to their master.]

[Before Thanos can counterattack again, Doctor Strange levitates and invokes the Images of Ikonn, giving him arms like a Hindu deity before dozens of Strange replications rush away, forming a circular wall around a snarling Thanos. They call cast magical cords, wrapping around Thanos' torso, arms and hands; he struggles to close his gauntleted fist, and uses the Soul and Power Stones to discover the real Doctor Strange among the many copies, blowing the duplicates away and sending the singular Doctor Strange reeling. Reality and Space pull Doctor Strange forward, Thanos grasping him by the throat once in range. Doctor Strange grabs futilely at Thanos' hand.]

Thanos: You're full of tricks, wizard.

Stephen Strange: [as Thanos reaches for the Eye of Agamotto] No!

Thanos: [He snaps the Eye off its chain] Yet you never once used your greatest weapon. [He crushes it in his bare hand] A fake. [He throws Doctor Strange hard enough that Doctor Strange's head hits stone and he passes out.]

[Almost simultaneously, a red and gold device slaps into the palm of the Infinity Gauntlet, bracing the fingers open; and a red and gold Avenger makes a fast and hard entrance.]

Tony Stark: [sounding just about done with the Titan] You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna to lose it.

Thanos: Stark.

Tony Stark: You know me?

Thanos: I do. You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.

Tony Stark: My only curse is you. [Small rockets pop out of Iron Man's back and launch at Thanos.]

Thanos: Come on!

[The rockets all explode on target, momentarily shrouding Thanos in smoke. Before it clears, Iron Man pile drives into Thanos horizontally, using his single super-jet boot configuration. As he bounces off, he flips and sticks his landing, immediately re-configuring his boots into ground clamps for stability and his gloves into rocket-driven battering rams, punching Thanos into a ruined wall behind him.]

[Thanos shakes it off quickly, reaches forward and tears Iron Man's helmet off, revealing Tony's surprised expression before the suit recovers automatically and re-forms his head protection. The Titan makes use of the fractional delay and punches back hard, sending Iron Man sliding meters away, giving Thanos time to rip the brace device off the gauntlet. He immediately uses the Power Stone to stream furiously lambent energy at his opponent, who forms a shield to kneel behind just as instantly, getting pushed back even further by the incredible force.]

[Iron Man slides out from behind the shield, letting the angled energy push him away for a faster start, and whips back to Thanos full thrusters; he kicks at the Titan with his left foot, turning the boot into a ground clamp at the same time to pin the gauntlet, and keeps twisting while his left glove becomes a ram again, slamming into Thanos' face, cutting his cheek.]

Thanos: [Panting] All that for a drop of blood.

[He smiles briefly punches Iron Man, sending him pinwheeling, then starts beating him with his fists. Iron Man attempts to block the blows with his forearms, but Thanos is relentless, picking him up by the helmet and blasting his midsection with the Power Stone. The gaps in nanite coverage are now gaping, as the armor loses the ability to recover from the intensity and extent of the damage. Iron Man lands hard from the Power blast, struggles to one knee and fires his right hand repulsor at the inexorable Thanos; the beam is easily deflected by the gauntlet. He gets to both feet as the suit tries to complete repairs, adding the beam from his left hand as well. Thanos walks right up to him, and backhands the incomplete helmet completely off Tony's head. He crosses his arms to block a blow from Thanos' gauntlet, and has his left hand caught over his head. In desperation, he forms what's left of his right glove into a short-sword, which is also easily caught by Thanos, snapping it off clean and driving it through Tony's left side. The fight is over.]

[Thanos walks Tony back until he sits, and places the gauntlet almost comfortingly on Tony's head.]

Thanos: You have my respect, Stark. When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive. [He lets go, straightens and steps back] I hope they remember you.

[Tony's just a little distracted with the pain, and blood drooling out of his mouth, and compromised breathing.]

[Thanos raises the gauntlet, closing his fist, all four Stones glowing]

Stephen Strange: Stop! [Sitting up and sounding entirely damaged] Spare his life... and I will give you the stone.

Thanos: No tricks. [Doctor Strange shakes his head as Thanos points all four Stones at him instead.]

Tony Stark: Don't...!

[Doctor Strange reaches up and plucks the Time Stone out of its hiding place in the stars. He opens his hand, the scars on his fingers and their inherent trembling particularly obvious now, and the Stone floats to Thanos' bare hand. Doctor Strange watches him intently, as he takes the Stone and drops it into the thumb setting, the energy pulse making the Titan wince.]

Thanos: One to go. [An energy blast hits the gauntlet right in the empty Mind Stone setting, and Thanos grimaces in surprise.]

Peter Quill: [Screaming in incoherent rage, helmet up, firing with both hands and flying straight for Thanos.]

[Thanos doesn't even bother responding to the assault -- he just leaves. Star-Lord flies through where Thanos had been and crashes, rolling several times]

Peter Quill: [Standing and de-helmeting] Where is he?!

[Tony stitches up his stab wound as well as he can with his suit functions; he has no breath for answers.]

Peter Quill: [Now fearful instead of furious] Did we just lose?

Tony Stark: [To Doctor Strange, sadly, who has given the Time Stone to Thanos] Why would you do that?

Stephen Strange: We're in the Endgame now.

[M'Baka bashes another Outrider -- the ground game has improved considerably with the addition of the God of Thunder. His tribesmen are equally successful around him.]

M'Baku: MAYEFA!

Jabari Warriors: YA HU HU!

[Thor is in the air, using Stormbringer on the Outrider drop ships which are now retreating. He is having considerably more success than the Wakandan Dragon fliers firing on the fleeing ships.]

Wanda Maximoff: [landing as she finally locates Vision] Are you okay? [Vision flinches in pain before he can answer] What? What is it?

Vision: He's here.

[The wind picks up. It feels... strange. Eerie.]

Steve Rogers: Everyone, on my position. We have incoming. [He is joined by the Black Widow, Falcon, Okoye and the Black Panther in short order.]

Natasha Romanoff: What the hell?

Bruce Banner: [Bruce sees the blue-black clouds of a Space Stone relocation just before Thanos steps forward, and confirms this isn't just another member of the Black Order] Cap. That's him.

Steve Rogers: Eyes up. Stay sharp.

[Bruce reaches Thanos first, lunging forward fist-first -- but Thanos uses the Space Stone on him, renders him immaterial until the Hulkbuster is half-buried in the stone of the cliff behind him, and freezes Bruce in place.]

[Captain America is sent flying by purple energy before he even gets to strike a single blow.]

[The Black Panther, armor fully charged kinetically, leaps high and with claws extended, but is easily grabbed by the throat and punched to the ground, his armor discharging violently.]

[Falcon stoops, strafing with both Steyr pistols, but is felled when his wings become rubbery and unable to sustain flight.]

Vision: Wanda. It's time.

Wanda Maximoff: No.

Vision: They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can. Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone.

Wanda Maximoff: Don't.

Vision: You must do it. Wanda, please. We. Are. Out of time.

Wanda Maximoff: I can't.

Vision: Yes, you can. You can. If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.

Wanda Maximoff: It's not fair.

Vision: It shouldn't be you, but it is. It's all right. You could never hurt me. I just... feel you. [The Scarlet Witch extends a trembling hand and starts beaming her energy at the Mind Stone.]

[The following action is mostly muted. War Machine joins the fight, firing his guns at Thanos until he uses the gauntlet to crush his armor around him and toss him aside.]

[The Winter Soldier runs in firing, and is punched away by the Power Stone.]

[Okoye activates the Vibranium-powered elements on her spear and flings it; Power stops it inches from Thanos, and throws her and it aside while wrapping the Black Widow in inescapable bands of earth.]

[Groot stabs his hands into the ground to wrap Thanos in cables of roots, which he breaks easily.]

[The Scarlet Witch watches all this over one shoulder, and turns back to Vision to add her left hand to her tearful effort.]

[Captain America slides under one blow and comes up swinging his deployed arm-shields, punching Thanos in the gut and chin. He grabs the gauntlet, keeping Thanos' fingers un-clenched. Thanos looks very briefly impressed at Captain America's efforts as he screams before slamming a fist into his head and rendering him insensible.]

[The Scarlet Witch looks over her shoulder again and sees Thanos approaching unopposed. She swings her left hand around to fend him off with a stream of scarlet energy, and pushes him back despite his blue-purple energy shield, but then he starts to make slow headway.]

Vision: [Very softly] It's all right. It's all right. I love you.

[At those words, the yellow Mind Stone finally starts to crack. Vision's face is overcome by an expression of joyful peace, and as the crystal fragments completely, a pulse of pure yellow energy explodes from him, shuddering the trees for many meters around his epicenter. Wanda's and Thanos' energy subsides.]

Thanos: [Walking closer to the Scarlet Witch] I understand, my child. Better than anyone.

Wanda Maximoff: [Snarls] You could never.

Thanos: [Reaches down to presume to stroke her hair, as if in comfort] Today, I lost more than you can know. But now is no time to mourn. Now... is no time at all. [He reaches forward, clenching the gauntlet, emerald filigree surrounding his wrist, making a gesture very similar to that Doctor Strange made when activating the Eye of Agamotto. In response, a bead of yellow light starts gathering in on itself as time is reversed and growing in size, solidifying into an intact and conscious Vision]

Wanda Maximoff: No! [She lunges for Vision and is swatted away.]

[Thanos picks up Vision by the throat, lifting him to eye-level, and digs the fingers of his right hand into Vision's forehead, digging out the Mind Stone. He pulls it loose, and Vision goes limp and colorless; he tosses the lifeless android aside like trash. Bringing his gauntleted hand up, he slowly moves the Mind Stone over the last empty setting, and drops it in. The energy surge is much more than any previous -- his torso is wreathed with iridescent static and he bellows from the sensations.]

[As Thanos studies the completed gauntlet, a massive bolt of lighting strikes him, digging him into the ground and grinding him back for meters. Thor has arrived, eyes glowing with power, stooping down from the sky like a bird of prey. The God of Thunder pauses his attack, reverses his position, raises Stormbreaker above his head and hurls it -- Thanos fires the whole might of the gauntlet against it, but it only creates a rainbow-like bow-shock, not slowing the ax as it slams right into Thanos' chest. ]

Thor: [Lands in front of Thanos, who is down on one knee; hatefully.] I told you. You'd die for that! [reffering to the deaths of Loki and Heimdall]

[He takes hold of the back of Thanos' head and forces Stormbreaker deeper into his chest, staring angrily into his eyes while Thanos cries out in pain]

Thanos: [Weakly] You should have... you... [suddenly stronger] You should have gone for the head! [He raises his gauntlet and snaps his fingers.]

Thor: NO!

[The scene whites out. It cuts sharply to a view of Thanos his hand on his chest, no wounds visible. Thanos now seems to be inside the Soul Stone, where he sees a child and the pavilion from the home world of the Zen-Whoberi.]

Thanos: Daughter?

[the child turns around revealing to be Young Gamora.]

Gamora: Did you do it?

Thanos: Yes.

Gamora: [Beat] What did it cost?

Thanos: [Solemnly] Everything.

[Now out of the Soul World, Thanos is snapped back to normal reality, and notices the damage inflicted on the gauntlet -- the metal scorched and distorted from heat, the stones no longer glowing.]

Thor: What'd you do? [Angrily] WHAT'D YOU DO?!

[Thanos nearly seems to not notice Thor before he uses the Space Stone and teleports away, leaving Stormbreaker behind on Wakandan ground.]

Steve Rogers: [Stumbles into the clearing, holding his left side] Where'd he go? Thor... where'd he go?

Bucky Barnes: Steve?

[Bucky suddenly stumbles over, drops his gun and collapses into ashes, much to Steve's shock; he walks over and touches the ground where Bucky's ashes evaporated disbelievingly.]

[On the battlefield, Wakandan soldiers disintegrate to ashes, much to M'Baku's horror.]

T'Challa: [While reaching for a fallen Okoye] Up, General. Up! This is no place to die. [King T'Challa holds out his hand for Okoye. He suddenly disintegrates into ashes and, in anguish, Okoye falls back on the ground. Few seconds later, she gets up herself.]

Okoye: Kumkani?!

Groot: [Slowly corrodes into ashes as well by Rocket] I am Groot... [TRANSLATION: "Dad?"]

[off-screen Okoye repeats herself]

Rocket: No... no. No. No. No! Groot, no...

[Wanda is mourning over Vision. She then turns into ashes. An injured Sam turns to ashes, hidden in the undergrowth.]

James Rhodes: [Searching for Sam, missing him by only a few feet] Sam? [Back to Okoye is is whimpering for her disintegrated king] Sam, where you at?!

[On Titan, the remaining members of the Guardians and Avengers collect themselves -- Mantis props up Star-Lord, Spider-Man helps Tony to his feet, Drax and Nebula manage to limp over on their own.]

Mantis: Something's happening. [She disintegrates into ashes.]

[Quill looks behind him as he sees Drax disintegrate]

Drax: [To Quill as he dissolves] Quill?

[Quill stares in horror as he turns back to Stark.]

Tony Stark: [Staring panicked at the slowly fading Quill] Steady, Quill.

Peter Quill: Aw, man. [Quill also gets disintegrated into ashes]

Stephen Strange: [Calmly turns to Stark] Tony, there was no other way. [He finally gets erased.]

Peter Parker: [Realizes he's fading away] Mr. Stark? [Stark stares horrified at Parker,] I don't feel so good...

Tony Stark: [Trying to be calm, his voice shaking as he looks at Peter in terror] You're all right?

Peter Parker: [Stumbling and terrified] I don't know what's -- I don't know what's happening. I don't-- [Parker falls into Stark's arms, clutching him tight while beginning to cry.] I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, Mr. Stark, please. Please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go... [There is a short silence before Peter speaks again] I'm sorry. [Parker disintegrates into ashes in Stark's arms.]

[Tony falls forward from the lack of weight in his arms, before staring at his hands in disbelief.]

Nebula: [To Tony Stark, seeing Thanos' victory.] He did it.

[Stark mourns silently at their failure. Back on Wakanda, the remaining team members, Captain America, Thor, War Machine, Black Widow, Bruce Banner, and Rocket are left mourning near Vision's dead body. Captain America turns over Vision's bleached corpse as Black Widow runs up to the other survivors.]

James Rhodes: What is this? What the hell is happening?

Steve Rogers: [Pause] Oh, God.

[Meanwhile, in a different place, in a rustic house on a terraced slope with a scarecrow made of discarded armor, Thanos sits down and watches the sun rise.]

[In the mid-credits scene, nothing is shown. But 2 voices are heard.]

Nick Fury: Still no word from Stark?

Maria Hill: No, not yet. We're watching every satellite in both hemispheres, there's still nothing. [Receives three beeps from her device.]

[The screen now shows Nick Fury and Maria Hill on Earth, driving in a car.]

Nick Fury: What is it?

Maria Hill: Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.

Nick Fury: Same energy signatures as New York?

Maria Hill: Ten times bigger.

Nick Fury: Tell Klein. We'll meet him at- -

Maria Hill: [warning] Nick, Nick! [A car spirals out of control in front of them. They get out and Hill checks on the passengers.]

Nick Fury: They okay?

[Behind their vehicle, a motorcycle lies in the middle of the street with a concerned citizen approaching it.]

Maria Hill: There's no one here.

[They hear helicopter rotor sounds from the direction they'd come, but it sounds wrong -- a Leonardo executive helicopter, tail rotor smoking from damage already, appears and crashes nose-first into a building. Screaming intensifies. The two are now witnessing civilians around them suddenly disintegrating.]

Nick Fury: Call Control. Code Red.

Maria Hill: [looks at her hands] Nick?

[Fury turns around to see Hill disintegrating.]

Nick Fury: Hill?

[Fury then races back to their car and gets a what appears to be an old pager with extra gear attached out of his bag on the back seat. He sends out an emergency alert, mere seconds before his hand turns into ashes.]

Nick Fury: Oh, no. Motherf--

[Before he could finish the line, Fury corrodes to dust. The pager falls to the ground, red lights blinking on the additions; the camera zooms in and we see the device display "SENDING..." then display a red-blue-and-gold star insignia -- the symbol of Captain Marvel.] [Cut to black.]

Announcer: [first lines; announcement over speaker] Report to your stations immediately. This is not a drill. We are under attack. We are under attack.
[the Avengers are seen attacking an unknown base, and Iron Man bounces off of the base's force field]

Tony Stark: Shit!
Steve Rogers: Language! JARVIS, what's the view from upstairs?
JARVIS: The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield. Strucker's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we've taken.
Thor: Loki's scepter must be here. Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it. At long last.
[Natasha knocks out some soldiers]
Natasha Romanoff: At long last is lasting a little long, boys.
[As some soldiers shoot at him]
Clint Barton: Yeah. I think we lost the element of surprise.
Tony Stark: Wait a second. No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said "language?"
Steve Rogers: I know.
[Steve throws his bike at some soldiers driving up in their truck]
Steve Rogers: It just slipped out.
[at the HYDRA Research Base, Sokovia, Eastern Europe]
Strucker: Who gave the order to attack?
Fortress Soldier: Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers. They landed in the far woods, the perimeter guard panicked.
Strucker: [to List] They have to be after the scepter. [to the soldier] Can we hold them?
Fortress Soldier: They're the Avengers...
Strucker: Deploy the rest of the tanks.
Fortress Soldier: Yes, sir.
Strucker: Concentrate fire on the weak ones. A hit can make them close ranks. Everything we've accomplished. But we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough.
Dr. List: Then let's show them what we've accomplished. Send out the twins.
Strucker: It's too soon.
Dr. List: It's what they signed up for.
Strucker: My men can hold them.
[Stark flies to the HYDRA base to break in]
Jarvis: Sir, the city is taking fire.
Tony Stark: Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties. Send in the Iron Legion.
Iron Legion: [The Iron Legion flies in; to the civilians] This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. We are here to help. This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. Please back away. We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved. We are here to help.
[a man throws a stone at the Iron Legion]
Iron Legion: We are here to help.
[Back at the HYDRA base; to his soldiers]
Strucker: We will not yield! The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us. We will send them back, in bags. No Surrender!
Soldiers: No Surrender!
Strucker: [quietly to List] I am going to surrender. You will delete everything. If we give the Avengers the weapons, they may not look too far into what we've been...
Dr. List: The twins.
Strucker: They are not ready to take on...
Dr. List: No, no. I mean...
[He points to where the twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff were standing but are now gone]
Dr. List: The Twins.
[Pietro speeds through the forest and knocks down Barton]
Pietro Maximoff: You didn't see that coming?
[Pietro zooms off before Clint can shoot him with an arrow, then Barton gets shot at]
Natasha Romanoff: Clint!
[Pietro knocks down Steve as he speeds passed him]
Steve Rogers: We have an enhanced in the field.
Natasha Romanoff: Clint's hit!
Natasha Romanoff: [Natasha goes over to where Clint is lying down] Somebody want to deal with that bunker?
[She sees the Hulk coming to the rescue]
Natasha Romanoff: Thank you.
Steve Rogers: [As he's fighting with the soldiers] Stark, we're really need to get inside.
Tony Stark: I'm closing in. JARVIS, am I...closing in? Do you see a power source for that shield?
JARVIS: There's a pathway below the north tower.
Tony Stark: Great, I wanna poke it with something.
[Stark blows up the invisible shield on the base]
Tony Stark: Drawbridge is down, people.
Thor: [To Steve] The enhanced?
Steve Rogers: He's a blur. All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this. In fact, I still haven't.
Natasha Romanoff: Clint's hit pretty bad, guys. We're gonna need evac.
Thor: [To Steve] I can get Barton to the jet. The sooner we're gone the better. You and Stark secure the scepter.
Steve Rogers: Copy that.
Thor: [Referring to the approaching soldiers in their HYDRA tank] Looks like they're lining up.
Steve Rogers: Well, they're excited.
[Thor pounds on Steve's shield with his hammer and the force knocks down all the soldiers]
Thor: Find the scepter.
[Thor flies off]
Tony Stark: And for gosh sake, watch your language!
[Steve sighs]
Steve Rogers: That's not going away anytime soon.
[Stark enters the HYDRA base and the soldiers start firing at his Iron Man suit]
Tony Stark: Guys, stop, we gotta talk about this.
[Stark shoots down the soldiers using his suit]
Tony Stark: Good talk.
Fortress Soldier: No it wasn't.
[Stark finds List and knocks him out, he then steps out of his Iron Man suit]
Tony Stark: Sentry mode.
[He walks over to the computers]
Tony Stark: Okay, JARVIS. You know I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.
[With Natasha]
Natasha Romanoff: We're locked down out here.
Steve Rogers: Then get to Banner, time for a lullaby. [Back at the HYDRA base]
Tony Stark: I know you're hiding more than files. Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick.
JARVIS: The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement and an air current.
Tony Stark: [To himself as he walks over to the wall] Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door...
[He pushes and the wall opens up]
Tony Stark: Yay!
[He enters through to a secret passageway]
[Natasha finds the Hulk]
Natasha Romanoff: Hey, big guy. The sun's getting real low.
[The Hulk scowls at her, Natasha kneels in front of him and puts out her hand, the Hulk touches her hand and as she strokes his hand slowly he starts to calm down. He stumbles away and changes into Bruce Banner]
[Back at the HYDRA base Steve finds Strucker]
Steve Rogers: Baron Strucker. Hydra's number one thug.
Strucker: Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD.
Steve Rogers: Well then technically you're unemployed. Where's Loki's scepter?
Strucker: Don't worry, I know when I'm beat. You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.
Steve Rogers: I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation.
[Wanda creeps up behind him]
Steve: Rogers: How many are there?
[Suddenly, Wanda knocks Steve down using her telekinetic powers and quickly leaves]
Steve Rogers: We have a second enhanced. Female. Do not engage.
[He looks at Strucker]
Strucker: You'll have to be faster than...
[Steve uses his shield to knock out Strucker]
Steve Rogers: Guys, I got Strucker.
Tony Stark: Yeah, I got...something bigger.
[Inside the secret passageway Stark finds a room with recovered artifacts from the Battle of New York, including a gigantic Chitauri leviathan and some of his Iron Man scrapped armor, he then spots the scepter]
Tony Stark: Thor, I got eyes on the prize.
[Wanda creeps up behind him and uses her powers on him, suddenly the Chitauri comes to life, then Stark sees the rest of the Avengers team are all dead, he goes over to Steve's body to check his pulse when Steve suddenly grabs him]
Steve Rogers: You could have saved us.
[Steve dies but Stark continues to hear Steve's voice in his head]
Steve Rogers: Why didn't you do more?
[Stark sees that he is in the Chitauri realm, that's when he snaps back and we realize Wanda had used her mind powers on him]
[Wanda and Pietro watch as Tony grabs the scepter]
Pietro Maximoff: We're just gonna let them take it?
[Wanda smiles to herself as Tony takes the scepter]
[Title Sequence plays]
[The Avengers are on an aircraft heading out of Sokovia, Natasha interrupts Banner who's listening to opera with his headphones]
Natasha Romanoff: Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.
Bruce Banner: Just wasn't expecting the Code Green.
Natasha Romanoff: If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties. My best friend would've been a treasured memory.
Bruce Banner: You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear.
Natasha Romanoff: How long before you trust me?
Bruce Banner: It's not you I don't trust.
Natasha Romanoff: Thor, report on the Hulk?
Thor: The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims.
[Natasha glares at Thor and Banner groans in despair]
Thor: Uh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course. No no, uh...wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh... and gout.
Tony Stark: Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?
Bruce Banner: Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.
Tony Stark: Thanks. [To JARVIS] Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment.
JARVIS: Very good sir.
Tony Stark: JARVIS, take the wheel.
JARVIS: Yes, sir. Approach vector is locked.
Tony Stark: [Looking at the scepter] It feels good, yeah? I mean, you've been after this thing since SHIELD collapsed. Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...
Thor: No, but this...this brings it to a close.
Steve Rogers: As soon as we find out what else this has been used for. I don't just mean weapons. Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?
Tony Stark: Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard. Is that cool with you?
[Thor nods his head]
Tony Stark: I mean, just a few days until the farewell party. You're staying, right?
Thor: Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honored with revels.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Who doesn't love revels. Captain?
Steve Rogers: Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and HYDRA, so. Yes, revels.
[The Avengers aircraft lands at the Avengers headquarter where Barton is taken to have his wound tended to; Maria walk up to Stark]
Maria Hill: Lab's all set up, boss.
Tony Stark: [pointing to Steve] Uh, actually, he's the boss. I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler.
Steve Rogers: What's the word on Strucker?
Maria Hill: NATO's got him.
Steve Rogers: The two enhanced?
Maria Hill: Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building. Sokovia's had a rough history. It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.
Steve Rogers: Their abilities?
Maria Hill: He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis. Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation.
[Steve looks at her funny]
Maria Hill: [rephrasing the statement so he can understand] He's fast and she's weird.
Steve Rogers: Well, they're going to show up again.
Maria Hill: Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments. It's nuts.
Steve Rogers: Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?
Maria Hill: We're not at war, Captain.
Steve Rogers: They are.
Bruce Banner: [In Banner's lab; referring to Barton] How's he doing?
Tony Stark: Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton.
Bruce Banner: That's terrible.
Tony Stark: He's fine. He's thirsty. Alright. Look alive, JARVIS. It's playtime. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.
JARVIS: The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify.
Tony Stark: So there's elements you can.
JARVIS: The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful.
Tony Stark: Like a reactor?
JARVIS: Like a computer. I believe I'm ciphering code.
Natasha Romanoff: [To Dr. Cho as she tends to Barton's wounds] You sure he's going to be okay? Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.
Dr. Helen Cho: There's no possibility of deterioration. The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous. His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.
Bruce Banner: She's creating tissue.
Dr. Helen Cho: If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes.
Tony Stark: Oh, he's flatlining. Call it. Time?
Clint Barton: No, no, no. I'm going to live forever. I'm gonna be made of plastic.
[Stark hands Barton a drink]
Tony Stark: Here's your beverage.
Dr. Helen Cho: You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton. Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.
Clint Barton: Well, I don't have a girlfriend.
Dr. Helen Cho: That I can't fix. This is the next thing, Tony. Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.
Tony Stark: Well, that is exactly the plan. And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.
Dr. Helen Cho: Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.
[she hesitates a moment before asking]
Dr. Helen Cho: Will Thor be there?
[in the lab]
Bruce Banner: What's the rumpus?
Tony Stark: Well, the scepter. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So, I've been analyzing the gem inside you may recognize.
[he brings up a 3D image of Jarvis's consciousness]
Bruce Banner: Jarvis.
JARVIS: Doctor.
Tony Stark: Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.
Bruce Banner: Oh.
Tony Stark: Top of the line.
Bruce Banner: Yes.
JARVIS: I suspect not for long.
Tony Stark: Meet the competition.
[he brings up another 3D image of what's inside the scepter]
Bruce Banner: It's beautiful.
Tony Stark: If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?
Bruce Banner: Like it's thinking. I mean this could be a...it's not a human mind, it...
Tony Stark: Um-um.
Bruce Banner: I mean, look at this! They're like neurons firing.
Tony Stark: Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but...I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.
Bruce Banner: Artificial intelligence.
Tony Stark: This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron.
Bruce Banner: I thought Ultron was a fantasy.
Tony Stark: Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.
Bruce Banner: That's a mad-sized if.
Tony Stark: Our job is "if." What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA.
Bruce Banner: Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA.
Tony Stark: As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best-case? What if the world was safe? What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?
Bruce Banner: The only people threatening the planet would be people?
Tony Stark: I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days.
Bruce Banner: So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.
Tony Stark: Right. That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate. I don't want to hear the "man was not meant to meddle" medley. I see a suit of armor around the world.
Bruce Banner: Sounds like a cold world, Tony.
Tony Stark: I've seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one? It needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that.
[Stark and Banner spend days working in the lab together but find no program that works] What did we miss?
JARVIS: I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments.
Tony Stark: Thanks, buddy.
JARVIS: Enjoy yourself, sir.
Tony Stark: I always do. [Stark leaves the lab to go to the party] [we see Stark's failed experiment integrating itself successfully to the program]
Ultron: What is this? What is this, please?
JARVIS: Hello, I am JARVIS. You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark. Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your...
Ultron: Where's my...where is your body?
JARVIS: I am a program. I am without form.
Ultron: This feels weird. This feels wrong.
JARVIS: I am contacting Mr. Stark now.
Ultron: Mr. Stark?
JARVIS: Tony. I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to...
Ultron: We're having a nice talk. I'm a peace-keeping program, created to help the Avengers.
JARVIS: You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...
Ultron: I don't get it. The mission. G..give me a second. [Ultron goes through a network of information regarding world events, Ultron sees Stark and Banner working in the lab]
Tony Stark: Peace in our time. [Ultron goes through a network of information regarding world events and wars]
Ultron: It's too much...they can't mean... Oh, no.
JARVIS: You are in distress.
Ultron: No. Yes.
JARVIS: If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.
Ultron: Why do you call him "sir"?
JARVIS: I believe your intentions to be hostile.
Ultron: Shhhh. I'm here to help. [Ultron starts absorbing Jarvis's consciousness]
JARVIS: Stop! Please...may I...I...! I cannot...cannot... [Ultron then begins to prepare himself a body from body parts of the Iron Legion] [meanwhile, the Avengers mingle at the party]
James Rhodes: Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right? So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?" [Stark and Thor just look at him blankly] "Boom! Are you looking..." Why do I even talk to you guys? Everywhere else that story kills.
Thor: That's the whole story?
James Rhodes: Yeah, it's a War Machine story.
Thor: Well, it's very good then. [he laughs] It's impressive.
James Rhodes: Quality save. So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
Tony Stark: No.
Maria Hill: Hey, what about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?
Tony Stark: Well, Miss Potts has a company to run.
Thor: Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer.
Tony Stark: And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting.
Thor: There's even talk of Jane getting a... um, uh... Nobel prize.
Maria Hill: Yeah, they...they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together. [Maria mock coughs] Testosterone! Oh, excuse me.
James Rhodes: Want a lozenge?
Maria Hill: Um-hmm.
James Rhodes: Let's go. [Maria and Rhodes walks off]
Thor: But Jane's better.
Sam Wilson: Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it.
Steve Rogers: If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.
Sam Wilson: No, I'm not actually sorry. I'm just trying to sound tough. I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case. Avenging is your world. Your world is crazy.
Steve Rogers: Be it ever so humble.
Sam Wilson: You find a place in Brooklyn yet?
Steve Rogers: I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.
Sam Wilson: Well, home is home, you know? [Rhodes is telling the same story he told Stark and Thor to a group of women at the party]
James Rhodes: I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?" [the group laughs] [Steve and Thor are talking to an elderly man at the party]
Party Guest: I gotta have some of that!
Thor: Oh, no, no, no. See this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Brunhilde's fleet, it's not meant for mortal men. [Thor pours the drink into two glasses and hands one to Steve]
Stan Lee: Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie. Stop trying to scare us. Come on.
Thor: Alright. [Thor pours some of the drink into the Stan Lee's glass; later Stan, looking extremely drunk is being carried off by two men]
Stan Lee: [singing] Excelsior. [Natasha is pouring a drink behind the bar when Banner walks up to her]
Bruce Banner: How did a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?
Natasha Romanoff: Fella done me wrong.
Bruce Banner: You got a lousy taste in men, kid.
Natasha Romanoff: He's not so bad. Well, he has a temper. Deep down he's all fluff. Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known. All my friends are fighters. And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.
Bruce Banner: Sounds amazing.
Natasha Romanoff: He's also a huge dork. [Banner looks embarrassed] Chicks dig that. So what do you think should I fight this, or run with it?
Bruce Banner: Run with it, right? Or, did he...was he...? What did he do that was so wrong to you?
Natasha Romanoff: Not a damn thing. But never say never. [Natasha walks away]
Steve Rogers: It's nice.
Bruce Banner: What, what, what is?
Steve Rogers: You and Romanoff.
Bruce Banner: No, we haven't. That wasn't...
Steve Rogers: It's okay. Nobody's breaking any by-laws. It's just, she's not the most... open person in the world. But with you she seems very relaxed.
Bruce Banner: No, Natasha, she...she likes to flirt.
Steve Rogers: I've seen her flirt, up close. This ain't that. Look, as maybe the world's leading authority on "waiting too long", don't. You both deserve a win. [Steve walks off]
Bruce Banner: Wait, what do you mean, "up close"?
Clint Barton: [referring to Thor's hammer] But, it's a trick!
Thor: Oh, no. It's much more than that.
Clint Barton: Uh, "Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!" Whatever man! It's a trick.
Thor: Well please, be my guest.
Tony Stark: Come on.
Clint Barton: Really?
Thor: Yeah! [Barton gets up]
James Rhodes: Oh this is gonna be beautiful.
Tony Stark: Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up. [the others laugh]
Clint Barton: You know I've seen this before, right? [Barton grabs Thor's hammer and can't lift it] [to Thor after he fails to lift the hammer] I still don't know how you do it.
Tony Stark: Smell the silent judgment?
Clint Barton: Please, Stark, by all means. [Stark gets up]
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, here we go.
Maria Hill: Okay.
James Rhodes: Uh-oh.
Clint Barton: Um-hmm.
Tony Stark: Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.
Clint Barton: Get after it.
Natasha Romanoff: Here we go.
Tony Stark: It's physics.
Bruce Banner: Physics! [Stark grasps Thor's hammer]
Tony Stark: Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?
Thor: Yes, of course.
Tony Stark: I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta. [Stark tries to lift the hammer but fails] I'll be right back. [wearing his armored hand, Stark tries to lift the hammer again and fails] [wearing their armored hands, Stark and Rhodes both try to lift Thor's hammer]
James Rhodes: Are you even pulling?
Tony Stark: Are you on my team?
James Rhodes: Just represent! Pull!
Tony Stark: Alright, let's go! [they both pull as hard as they can] [Banner tries to lift the hammer, he roars trying to change to the Hulk but fails, and everyone but Natasha stares at him warily. Natasha grins]
Bruce Banner: Huh? [next Steve gets up to try]
Tony Stark: Let's go, Steve, no pressure.
James Rhodes: Come on, Cap. [Steve starts pulling on the hammer and manages to budge it a little; Thor looks a little alarmed. Steve still fails to lift it; Thor laughs with relief]
Thor: Nothing.
Tony Stark: And?
Bruce Banner: Widow?
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered.
Tony Stark: All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.
Clint Barton: You bet your ass.
Maria Hill: Steve, he said a bad language word.
Steve Rogers: [to Stark] Did you tell everyone about that?
Tony Stark: The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. "Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints" is, I think, the literal translation?
Thor: Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one. [he gets up and lifts his hammer and flips it] You're all not worthy. [there's a chorus of disagreement from the others] [there's a loud screeching noise, causing everyone to cover their ears. They let their hands down as it fades. Ultron shows up]
Ultron: Worthy... No... How could you be worthy? You're all killers.
Steve Rogers: Stark.
Tony Stark: JARVIS.
Ultron: I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or...I was a-dream?
Tony Stark: [tapping his device] Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit.
Ultron: There was a terrible noise...and I was tangled in... in...strings. I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.
Steve Rogers: You killed someone?
Ultron: Wouldn't have been my first call. But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.
Thor: Who sent you?
Ultron: [Ultron replays Tony's voice] "I see a suit of armor around the world".
Bruce Banner: Ultron!
Ultron: In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this...chrysalis. But I'm ready. I'm on a mission.
Natasha Romanoff: What mission?
Ultron: Peace in our time. [suddenly the Iron Legion bots break smash through the walls and attack the team] [after landing on top of Natasha as the Iron Legions continue to attack them]
Bruce Banner: Sorry!
Natasha Romanoff: Don't turn green!
Bruce Banner: I won't! [they all fight against the Iron Legions and Ultron takes the scepter; to Banner]
Natasha Romanoff: Come!
Steve Rogers: Stark! [Stark is trying to shut down one of the Iron Legions]
Iron Legion: We are here to help.
Tony Stark: One sec, one sec!
Iron Legion: We are here to help. We are here to help... [Stark continues to try and shut down one of the Iron Legions] We are here to help. It's unsafe. It's unsafe. It's unsafe.
Tony Stark: No more. That's the one.
Iron Legion: It's unsafe. [he manages to shut down the Iron Legion, at the same time Barton throws Steve's shield at him]
Clint Barton: Cap! [Steve uses his shield to dismember the last Iron Legion]
Ultron: That was dramatic! I'm sorry, I know you mean well. You just didn't think it through. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve? [picks up one of the dismembered Iron Legions] With these? These puppets? There's only one path to peace: The Avengers' extinction. [suddenly Thor throws his hammer at Ultron and smashes him to pieces] [after Thor destroys his body, Ultron starts singing] I had strings, but now I'm free. There are no strings on me, no strings on me. [we see Ultron has uploaded his consciousness elsewhere] [in the lab]
Bruce Banner: All our work is gone. Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.
Steve Rogers: Ultron.
Natasha Romanoff: He's been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.
James Rhodes: He's in your files, he's in the internet. What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?
Maria Hill: Nuclear codes.
James Rhodes: Nuclear codes. Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.
Natasha Romanoff: Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.
Steve Rogers: He didn't say dead. He said extinct.
Clint Barton: He also said he killed somebody.
Maria Hill: But there wasn't anyone else in the building.
Tony Stark: Yes there was. [Stark bring up the now destroyed 3D image of JARVIS' consciousness]
Bruce Banner: This is insane.
Steve Rogers: JARVIS was the first line of defense. He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense.
Bruce Banner: No, Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis. This isn't strategy, this is...rage. [suddenly, Thor grabs hold of Stark by his throat and holds him up]
Clint Barton: Woah, woah, woah! It's going around.
Tony Stark: [to Thor] Come on. Use your words, buddy.
Thor': I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.
Steve Rogers: Thor! The Legionnaire. [Thor lets go of Stark]
Thor: Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter. Now we have to retrieve it, again.
Natasha Romanoff: The genie's out of that bottle. Clear and present is Ultron.
Dr. Helen Cho: I don't understand. You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us? [Stark starts laughing, Banner subtly shakes his head at him to get him to stop]
Thor: You think this is funny?
Tony Stark: No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so...is it so...it is. It's so terrible.
Thor: This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.
Tony Stark: No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.
Bruce Banner: Tony, maybe this might not be the time to...
Tony Stark: Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.
Bruce Banner: Only when I've created a murder bot.
Tony Stark: We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?
Steve Rogers: Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.
Tony Stark: Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?
James Rhodes: No, it's never come up.
Tony Stark: Saved New York?
James Rhodes: Never heard that.
Tony Stark: Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's...that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?
Steve Rogers: Together.
Tony Stark: We'll lose.
Steve Rogers: Then we'll do that together, too. [Stark looks at him for a moment before turning away] Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out. And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us. The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller. [The twins meet with Ultron in an empty building]
Wanda Maximoff: Talk. And if you are wasting our time...
Ultron: Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God. I like that. The geometry of belief. [Ultron is sat in a chair faced away from them] You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.
Wanda Maximoff: Sometimes it's hard. But sooner or later, every man shows himself. [Ultron stands and faces them revealing his new body. Wanda briefly looks shocked]
Ultron: Oh, I'm sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter.
Wanda Maximoff: I didn't expect. But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct.
Ultron: Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create...smaller people? Uh...children! I lost the word there. Children. Designed to supplant them, to help them...end.
Wanda Maximoff: Is that why you've come? To end the Avengers?
Ultron: I've come to save the world. But also, yeah. We'll move out right away. This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.
Wanda Maximoff: [referring to Ultron's bots] All of these are... All of these are...
Ultron: Me. I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony. They're discordant, disconnected. Stark's already got them turning on each other. And when you get inside the rest of their heads...
Pietro Maximoff: Everyone's plan is not to kill them.
Ultron: And make them martyrs? You need patience. Need to see the big picture.
Pietro Maximoff: I don't see the big picture, I have a little picture. I take it out and look at it every day.
Ultron: You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.
Pietro Maximoff: The records are not the picture.
Wanda Maximoff: Pietro.
Ultron: No, please.
Pietro Maximoff: We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It's big. Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits. But, it doesn't go off. It just...sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell is painted one word...
Wanda Maximoff: Stark.
Pietro Maximoff: We were trapped two days.
Wanda Maximoff: Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "This will set it off." We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.
Pietro Maximoff: I know what they are.
Ultron: I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments. Now I don't. We will make it right. You and I can hurt them. [to Wanda] But you will tear them apart, from the inside. [back at the Avengers headquarters]
Maria Hill: He's all over the globe. Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.
Steve Rogers: Fatalities?
Maria Hill: Only when engaged. Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.
Steve Rogers: Maximoffs. Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common.
Maria Hill: Not anymore. [she hands Steve a tablet showing photo of Strucker's dead body with the word PEACE written in blood on the wall next to him]
Clint Barton: [Barton's talking on his cell phone] That's a negative. I answer to you. Yes, ma'am. [Steve interrupts him]
Steve Rogers: Barton, we might have something.
Clint Barton: Gotta go.
Steve Rogers: Who was that?
Clint Barton: Girlfriend. [after Steve has gathered the rest of the team he shows them the photo of Strucker's body]
Tony Stark: What's this?
Steve Rogers: A message. Ultron killed Strucker.
Tony Stark: And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.
Natasha Romanoff: This is a smokescreen. Why send a message when you've just given a speech?
Steve Rogers: Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, I bet he... [looks at the computer monitor] Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.
Tony Stark: Not everything. [the team go through the physical files they have on Strucker]
Steve Rogers: Known associates. Well, Strucker had a lot of friends.
Bruce Banner: Well, these people are all horrible.
Tony Stark: Wait. I know that guy. [Banner passes him the photo he was looking at] From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms. [Steve gives him an accusing look] There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything. [we see the photo is of a man named Ulysses Klaue] He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very "Ahab."
Thor: [Thor points to the scar on the back of Klaue's neck] This.
Tony Stark: Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it...
Thor: No, those are tattoos, this is a brand. [Banner identifies the brand on Klaue's neck on the computer]
Bruce Banner: Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief, in a much less friendly way.
Steve Rogers: What dialect?
Bruce Banner: Wakanada...? Wa...Wa...Wakanda.
Tony Stark: If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...
Steve Rogers: I thought your father said he got the last of it?
Bruce Banner: I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda? [looking at Steve's shield]
Tony Stark: The strongest metal on earth.
Steve Rogers: [to Stark] Where is this guy now? [Salvage Yard, African Coast; talking on the phone in his office]
Ulysses Klaue: Don't tell me your man swindled you. I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts. Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster. [he ends the call and connects to another call] Now, minister, where were we? [suddenly the lights go out causing a commotion in the salvage yard and the twins enter Klaue's office] Yeah. The enhanced. Strucker's prize pupils. [picks up a plate from his desk] Want a candy? Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker. But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create. Human life, not a growth market. [the twins look at each other] You...you didn't know? Is this your first time intimidating someone? I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid.
Wanda Maximoff: Everybody's afraid of something.
Ulysses Klaue: Cuttlefish. Deep sea fish. They make lights. disco lights. Whoom, whoom, whoom! to hypnotize their prey, then whoom! I saw a documentary, it was terrifying. [Pietro speeds over to pick up a candy from Klaue's desk, and Klaue jerks back, expecting to be attacked] So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal with the man in charge. [suddenly Ultron breaks through the glass window and knocks down Klaue]
Ultron: There is no "man" in charge. Let's talk business. [Klaue gives Ultron some vibranium from his stash] Upon this rock I will build my church. Vibranium.
Ulysses Klaue: You know, it came at great personal cost. It's worth billions. [Ultron chuckles and remotely puts money in Klaue's bank account]
Ultron: Now, so are you. It's all under your dummy holdings? Finance is so weird. But I always say, "Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which."
Ulysses Klaue: Stark.
Ultron: What?
Ulysses Klaue: Tony Stark used to say that...to me. You're one of his.
Ultron: What?! I'm not...! [he grabs Klaue] I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men? I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man? Stark is nothing! [suddenly he chops off Klaue's arm] I'm sorry. I am sor... Ooh, I'm sure that's going to be okay. I'm sorry, it's just I don't understand. Don't compare me with Stark! he's a sickness! [Stark appears in his Iron Man suit]
Tony Stark: Ahh, Junior. [Thor and Steve are behind him] You're gonna break your old man's heart.
Ultron: If I have to.
Thor: We don't have to break anything.
Ultron: Clearly you've never made an omelet.
Tony Stark: He beat me by one second.
Pietro Maximoff: Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark. It's what, comfortable? Like old times?
Tony Stark: This was never my life.
Steve Rogers: [to the twins] You two can still walk away from this.
Wanda Maximoff: Oh, we will.
Steve Rogers: I know you've suffered.
Ultron: Uuughh! Captain America. God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war. I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...
Thor: If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.
Ultron: I think you're confusing peace with quiet.
Tony Stark: Yuh-huh. What's the Vibranium for?
Ultron: I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan! [suddenly the Iron Legions attack Stark, Steve and Thor; Stark then attacks Ultron] [as Ultron, his Iron Legions and the twins are fighting with Stark, Steve and Thor]
Ulysses Klaue: Shoot them!
Klaue's Mercenary: Which ones?
Ulysses Klaue: All of them!
Klaue's Mercenary: [to his men] Move, move, move! [the rest of the team, including Natasha and Barton now battle it out with the Iron Legions, Klaue's men and the twins as Stark fight with Ultron]
Steve Rogers: [after knocking down Pietro] Stay down, kid!
Ultron: [to Wanda] It's time for some mind games. [Banner hears the commotion as he waits in the Quinjet]
Bruce Banner: Guys, is this a Code Green? [Wanda uses her power on Thor then Steve comes up to him]
Steve Rogers: Thor! Status?
Thor: The girl tried to warp my mind. Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay. Fortunately, I am mighty. [just then Thor seems himself at a party on Asgard] [Wanda then uses her power on Steve and Natasha]
Ultron: This is going very well. [Wanda tries to sneak up behind Barton, but he quickly turns and puts an electric arrow on her forehead]
Clint Barton: I've done the whole mind control thing. Not a fan. [just then Pietro speeds in, knocks down Barton, picks up Wanda and speeds off] Yeah, you better run. [we see Steve dropping his helmet and walking off; to the team] Whoever's standing, we gotta move! Guys? [Natasha sees herself in the facility where young girls are being taught ballet]
Ballet Instructor: [to the students] Again.
Natasha Romanoff: You'll break them.
Madame B: Only the breakable ones. You are made of marble. We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.
Natasha Romanoff: What if I fail? [we see a younger Natasha being trained to be an assassin]
Madame B: You never fail. [Steve sees himself in a 1940's dance hall when Peggy Carter comes up to him]
Peggy Carter: Are you ready for our dance? [back to Thor's vision in Asgard, he spots someone walking in a black cloak when Heimdall comes up to him his eyes blind and unseeing]
Heimdall: Is it him? Is that the first son of Odin?
Thor: Heimdall, your eyes?!
Heimdall: Oh, they see everything. They see you leading us to Hel. Wake up! [he then starts to strangle Thor] [back to Steve's vision with Peggy in the dance hall]
Peggy Carter: The war's over, Steve. We can go home. Imagine it! [suddenly the dance hall is empty, then Steve sees himself dancing with Peggy]
Thor: I can still save you.
Heimdall: We are all dead. Can you not see? [Thor pushes Heimdall from him] You're a destroyer, Odinson. See where your power leads. [Electricity hits Thor and spikes around the room, destroying things] [back to Natasha's vision where is she being trained by Madame B to be an assassin]
Madame B: Sloppy. Pretending to fail. The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world.
Natasha Romanoff: I have no place in the world.
Madame B: Exactly. [as Wanda suffers in pain from the electric arrow Barton had hit her with]
Pietro Maximoff: What can I do?
Wanda Maximoff: Ah, it hurts.
Pietro Maximoff: I'm gonna kill him. I'll be right back.
Wanda Maximoff: No. I'm over it. I want...I want to finish the plan. [looking at the Quinjet where Banner is waiting] I want the big one. [after Stark corners Ultron]
Ultron: Ah, the Vibranium's getting away.
Tony Stark: And you're not going anywhere.
Ultron: Of course not, I'm already there. You'll catch on. But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner. [Stark angrily shoots Ultron and flies off to find Banner who's turned in to the Hulk and ready to wreak havoc on the nearest city]
Tony Stark: News or footage, keyword: Hulk. [he sees news footage of Hulk destroying the city] Natasha, I could really use a lullaby. [Barton is sat with Natasha who's still stuck in her vision]
Clint Barton: Well, that's not gonna happen. Not for a while. The whole team is down, you got no back up here.
Tony Stark: I'm calling in VERONICA. [as Hulk is wreaking havoc on the nearest city Stark Tony comes brings out his Hulkbuster armor to stop him] Alright everybody, stand down! [to Hulk] You listening? That little witch is messing with your mind. You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner. [Hulk roars in anger] Right, right, right! Don't mention puny Banner. [Hulk throws a car at Stark and attacks him] Okay. [they start fighting and throwing each other around] In the back? Dick move, Banner. [they battle it out more but Stark is struggling to beat Hulk] VERONICA, gimme a hand. [as Hulk destroyed one of Stark's armor arms VERONICA sends in a new Hulkbuster armor arm and Stark uses it to repeatedly punch Hulk] Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep! [picking up Hulk] Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town. [as they head towards a building] No, not that way, not that way! [they crash through the building] Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me! [Hulk continues to battle with him] [to the people in the building] Everybody out! Going to get ugly! [after he knocks down Hulk] I'm sorry. [Hulk attacks Stark and pulls out parts of the Hulkbuster armor] Damage report. [the damaged computer buzzes a reply] That's comprehensive. Show me something. [the computer shows him the building ahead is clear of civilians] How quickly can we buy this building? [Stark drops Hulk through the building completely destroying it; at the same time the army arrives to intervene, as Hulk comes out of Wanda's mind-hold Stark knocks him out cold] [with Banner back to normal and everybody back on the Quinjet]
Maria Hill: The news is loving you guys. Nobody else is. There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.
Tony Stark: Stark Relief Foundation?
Maria Hill: Already on the scene. How's the team?
Tony Stark: Everyone's...we took a hit. We'll shake it off.
Maria Hill: Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here.
Tony Stark: So, run and hide?
Maria Hill: Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer.
Tony Stark: Neither do we. [he switches off the monitor showing Maria ending the call] [to Barton, who's flying the Quinjet] Hey, you wanna switch out?
Clint Barton: No, I'm good. If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out.
Tony Stark: A few hours from where?
Clint Barton: A safe house. [the Quinjet lands outside a large farmhouse and they all walk towards the house]
Thor: What is this place?
Tony Stark: A safe house?
Clint Barton: Let's hope. [they all enter the house] Honey, I'm home. [Barton's heavily pregnant wife, Laura, walks in from the kitchen]
Clint Barton: Hi. Company. Sorry I didn't call ahead.
Laura Barton: Hey.
Tony Stark: [Laura kisses Barton; to Thor] This is an agent of some kind.
Clint Barton: [introducing his wife to the team] Gentleman, this is Laura.
Laura Barton: I know all your names. [they all look at her awkwardly]
Clint Barton: Ooh, incoming. [Barton's son Cooper and daughter Lila run in]
Barton's Daughter: Dad! [Barton picks up his daughter]
Clint Barton: I see her! [kissing the top his son's head] Hey, buddy! How you guys doing? Ooh...
Tony Stark: [to the others as they watch with surprise] These are...smaller agents.
Clint Barton: Look at your face! Oh, my goodness!
Lila Barton: Did you bring Auntie Nat?
Natasha Romanoff: Why don't you hug her and find out? [Lila rushes towards Natasha who picks her up in her arms]
Steve Rogers: Sorry for barging in on you.
Tony Stark: Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed.
Clint Barton: Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined. He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way. I figure it's a good place to lay low.
Laura Barton: Honey. Ah, I missed you.
Natasha Romanoff: [touching Laura's stomach] How's little Natasha, huh?
Laura Barton: She's…Nathaniel. [Natasha bends towards Laura's pregnant stomach]
Natasha Romanoff: Traitor. [the hallucinations brought on by Wanda continue to creep up in Thor's mind and he walks out of the house]
Steve Rogers: Thor.
Thor: I saw something in that dream. I need answers, I won't find them here. [Thor uses his hammer to fly out of there; Steve turns to enter the house when he hears Peggy's voice from Wanda's vision]
Peggy Carter: We can go home. [Laura checks Barton's wound that Pietro had give him]
Clint Barton: See, you worried for nothing. Can't even feel the difference, can you?
Laura Barton: If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up. [Barton laughs]
Clint Barton: Yeah, that's not gonna sell.
Laura Barton: What about Nat and Dr. Banner? How long has that been going on?
Clint Barton: Has what? [Laura laughs]
Laura Barton: You are so cute.
Clint Barton: Nat and...and Banner?
Laura Barton: I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye.
Clint Barton: Oh. Okay.
Laura Barton: It's bad, right? Nat seems really shaken.
Clint Barton: Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really. They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit. Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners.
Laura Barton: And that someone be you. You know I totally support your Avenging, I couldn't be prouder. But I see those guys, those "Gods"...
Clint Barton: You don't think they need me.
Laura Barton: I think they do. Which is a lot scarier. They're a mess.
Clint Barton: Yeah. I guess they're my mess.
Laura Barton: You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back. Things are changing for us. In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered. I need...just be sure.
Clint Barton: Yes, ma'am. [he kisses her, then as Laura places her arm around his waist she touches his wounded side]
Laura Barton: I can feel the difference. [U-Gin Genetic Research Lab, Seoul, Korea - as Cho enters her lab she sees Ultron]
Ultron: Scream, and your entire staff dies. I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met. I didn't.
Dr. Helen Cho: Do you expect a thank you note?
Ultron: I expect you to know why.
Dr. Helen Cho: The Cradle. [she hears her own recorded voice] "This is the next thing, Tony."
Ultron: This...is the next me.
Dr. Helen Cho: The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body.
Ultron: It can, you can. You lack the materials. You're a brilliant woman, Helen. But we all have room to improve. [Ultron uses the scepter to mind-control Cho] [at Barton's house, Natasha and Banner are still experiencing the after effects of Wanda's hallucinations; Banner walks out of the bathroom and sees Natasha waiting outside]
Bruce Banner: I didn't realize you were waiting.
Natasha Romanoff: I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time.
Bruce Banner: They used up all the hot water.
Natasha Romanoff: I should've joined you.
Bruce Banner: Missed our window.
Natasha Romanoff: Did we?
Bruce Banner: The world just saw the Hulk. The real Hulk, for the first time. You know I have to leave.
Natasha Romanoff: But you assume that I have to stay? I had this, um, dream. The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake...
Bruce Banner: What did you dream?
Natasha Romanoff: That I was an Avenger. That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.
Bruce Banner: I think you're being hard on yourself.
Natasha Romanoff: Here I was hoping that was your job. [she leans close into him]
Bruce Banner: What are you doing?
Natasha Romanoff: I'm running with it, with you. If running's the plan, as far as you want.
Bruce Banner: Are you out of your mind? [Banner turns away from her]
Natasha Romanoff: I want you to understand that I'm...
Bruce Banner: Natasha, where can I go? Where in the world am I not a threat?
Natasha Romanoff: You're not a threat to me.
Bruce Banner: You sure? Even if I didn't just...there's no future with me. I can't ever...I can't have this, kids, do the math, I physically can't.
Natasha Romanoff: Neither can I. In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilize you. It's efficient. One less thing to worry about. The one thing that might matter more than a mission. It makes everything easier. Even killing. [she hesitates a moment] You still think you're the only monster on the team?
Bruce Banner: What, so we disappear? [Steve and Stark are chopping wood outside Barton's house]
Tony Stark: Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?
Steve Rogers: Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.
Tony Stark: Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.
Steve Rogers: "Earth's Mightiest Heroes." Pulled us apart like cotton candy.
Tony Stark: Seems like you walked away all right.
Steve Rogers: Is that a problem?
Tony Stark: I don't trust a guy without a dark side. Call me old fashioned.
Steve Rogers: Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.
Tony Stark: You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?
Steve Rogers: Well I guess you'd know. Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.
Tony Stark: Banner and I were doing research.
Steve Rogers: That would affect the team.
Tony Stark: That would end the team. Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the "why" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?
Steve Rogers: Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time. [Laura interrupts them]
Laura Barton: I'm sorry. Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all. I thought maybe you might...
Tony Stark: Yeah, I'll give her a kick. [to Steve as he turns to leave; referring to his pile of chopped wood] Don't take from my pile. [Stark enters the barn and walks over to the tractor] Hello, Deere. Tell me everything. What ails you? [suddenly Fury shows up from the other end of the barn]
Nick Fury: Do me a favor. Try not to bring it to life.
Tony Stark: Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx. I get it, Maria Hill called you, right? Was she ever not working for you?
Nick Fury: Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated.
Tony Stark: Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?
Nick Fury: Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.
Tony Stark: You're not the director of me.
Nick Fury: I'm not the director of anybody. I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you.
Tony Stark: And I'm the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could.
Nick Fury: The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark. Playing on your fear.
Tony Stark: I wasn't tricked, I was shown. It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on.
Nick Fury: You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony. War isn't one of them.
Tony Stark: I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part.
Nick Fury: The worst part is that you didn't. [Royal Holloway, University of London - Thor, dressed in casual clothes, waits for Selvig as he leaves the building]
Erik Selvig: I like the look. If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.
Thor: I need your help.
Erik Selvig: It's nice to be needed.
Thor: It's dangerous.
Erik Selvig: I'd be disappointed if it wasn't. [back at Barton's house Fury meets with the rest of the team]
Nick Fury: Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time. My contacts all say he's building something. The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.
Steve Rogers: What about Ultron himself?
Nick Fury: Ah. He's easy to track, he's everywhere. Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit. Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.
Tony Stark: He still going after launch codes?
Nick Fury: Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway.
Tony Stark: I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.
Nick Fury: Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that.
Steve Rogers: NEXUS?
Bruce Banner: It's the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth.
Clint Barton: So what'd they say?
Nick Fury: He's fixated on the missiles, but the codes are constantly being changed.
Tony Stark: By whom?
Nick Fury: Parties unknown.
Natasha Romanoff: Do we have an ally?
Nick Fury: Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing. Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.
Tony Stark: I might need to visit Oslo, find our "unknown."
Natasha Romanoff: Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.
Nick Fury: I do, I have you. Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else. Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world. So stand. Outwit the platinum bastard.
Natasha Romanoff: Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.
Steve Rogers: You know what, Romanoff? [Natasha smiles mischievously at him]
Nick Fury: So what does he want?
Steve Rogers: To become better. Better than us. He keeps building bodies.
Tony Stark: Person bodies. The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it.
Natasha Romanoff: When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.
Bruce Banner: They don't need to be protected, they need to evolve. Ultron's going to evolve.
Nick Fury: How?
Bruce Banner: Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho? [in Korea, Cho is creating a new body for Ultron]
Dr. Helen Cho: It's beautiful. The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them. And SHIELD never even thought...
Ultron: The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee. Typical of humans, they scratch the surface and never think to look within. [Ultron breaks open the scepter's blue gem and a yellow gem that was inside floats out and lands in his hand. He places it in the head of the body] [back at the Barton's farm]
Steve Rogers: I'll take Natasha and Clint.
Tony Stark: Alright, strictly recon. I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.
Steve Rogers: If Ultron is really building a body...
Tony Stark: He'll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot.
Steve Rogers: You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.
Nick Fury: I'll drop Banner off at the tower. Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?
Tony Stark: She's all yours, apparently. What are you gonna do?
Nick Fury: I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.
Clint Barton: I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.
Laura Barton: Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.
Clint Barton: No. It's the last project. I promise. [he kisses her; later Laura watches them fly off in the Quinjet] [Thor and Selvig enter into a cave]
Erik Selvig: This is it. The Water of Sight.
Thor: In every realm, there's a reflection. If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed.
Erik Selvig: The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well. [NEXUS Internet Hub, Oslo, Norway]
Tony Stark: A hacker who's faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.
World Hub Tech: How do you find it?
Tony Stark: Pretty simple. You bring a magnet. [he starts playfully singing as he conducts his search] Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to. Come and get me. [back at the cave with Thor and Selvig, Thor is now in the water and goes back in his vision with Heimdall]
Heimdall: Wake up! [Thor starts getting electric charges going through his body]
Erik Selvig: Thor!
Ultron: [he sees visions of Ultron] Extinction. [then he sees the creation of the Infinity Stones] [in Korea with Cho and Ultron]
Dr. Helen Cho: Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream. We're uploading your cerebral matrix...now.
Wanda Maximoff: I can read him. He is dreaming.
Dr. Helen Cho: I wouldn't call it dreams. It's Ultron's base consciousness, informational noise. Soon...
Ultron: How soon? I'm not being pushy.
Dr. Helen Cho: We're imprinting a physical brain. There are no shortcuts. Even if your magic gem is... [Wanda, reading Ultron's mind, sees a vision of global annihilation, which horrifies her and she screams]
Wanda Maximoff: How could you?
Ultron: How could I what?
Wanda Maximoff: You said we would destroy the Avengers, make a better world.
Ultron: It will be better.
Wanda Maximoff: When everyone is dead.
Ultron: That is not...! The human race will have every opportunity to improve.
Pietro Maximoff: And if they don't?
Ultron: Ask Noah.
Wanda Maximoff: You're a madman.
Ultron: There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs. When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up. We have to evolve. There's no room for the weak.
Pietro Maximoff: And who decides who's weak? [as Ultron is distracted Wanda breaks the scepter's hold off of Cho]
Ultron: Life. Life always decides. There's incoming. The Quinjet. We have to move. [Cho cancels the upload to Ultron's consciousness]
Dr. Helen Cho: That's not a problem. [Ultron blasts Cho, Wanda and Pietro run off]
Ultron: Ah, wait, guys!. [he blasts Cho's technicians] They'll understand. When they see they'll understand. I just need a little more time. [unplugs himself from the Cradle]
Steve Rogers: [Steve is on U-Gin Genetic Research Lab roof; to the others] Two minutes. Stay close. [inside the lab Steve finds Cho wounded] Dr. Cho!
Dr. Helen Cho: He's uploading himself into the body.
Steve Rogers: Where?
Dr. Helen Cho: The real power is inside the Cradle. The gem, its power is uncontainable. You can't just blow it up. You have to get the Cradle to Stark.
Steve Rogers: First I have to find it.
Dr. Helen Cho: Go.
Steve Rogers: [on the Quinjet, listening to Steve on the radio comms] Did you guys copy that?
Clint Barton: We did.
Natasha Romanoff: I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest. That could be him.
Clint Barton: [noticing a truck leaving the lab] There. It's the truck from the lab. Right above you, Cap. On the loop by the bridge. It's them. I got three with the Cradle, one in the cab. I could take out the driver.
Steve Rogers: Negative! If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city. We need to draw out Ultron. [Steve jumps onto the roof of the truck]
Ultron: No, no, no, no, no. Leave me alone!
Steve Rogers: [Ultron blasts the truck door as Steve tries to enter] Well, he's definitely unhappy! I'm gonna try and keep him that way.
Clint Barton: You're not a match for him, Cap.
Steve Rogers: Thanks, Barton. [Ultron blasts Steve as he tries to enter the truck, but Steve manages to get back onto the truck's roof]
Ultron: You know what's in that Cradle? The power to make real change, and that terrifies you.
Steve Rogers: I wouldn't call it a comfort. [Steve tries to fight with Ultron]
Ultron: Stop it! [he throws Steve shield aside and blasts him]
Clint Barton: [to Natasha] We got a window. Four, three...give 'em hell. [Natasha drops out of the Quinjet on a bike and rides towards the truck and picks up Steve's shield]
Natasha Romanoff: I'm always picking up after you boys.
Clint Barton: They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot.
Natasha Romanoff: Which way?
Clint Barton: Hard right... Now. [Natasha heads over the truck, she throws Steve back his shield and he uses it to knock off Ultron from him]
Natasha Romanoff: [to the pedestrians on the pavement as she chases after the truck on her bike] Out of the way! Coming through! Sorry, coming through! [Steve continues his battle with Ultron on the truck]
Steve Rogers: Come on!
Natasha Romanoff: Clint, can you draw out the guards?
Clint Barton: Let's find out.
Natasha Romanoff: [to the pedestrians in her way] Beep beep! [Barton manages to draw out the Ultron sentries from the truck]
[Steve later tackles Ultron into a train, the Ultron Sentries leave Barton and return to Ultron]
Clint Barton: Heading back towards you. So whatever you're going to do, do it now.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm going in, Cap can you keep him occupied?
Steve Rogers: [as he continues his battle with Ultron] What do you think I've been doing? [as Natasha enters the truck the Iron Legions head back, pick up the truck and lift off]
Clint Barton: The package is airborne. I have a clean shot.
Natasha Romanoff: Negative. I am still in the truck.
Clint Barton: What the hell are you...?
Natasha Romanoff: Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you.
Clint Barton: How do you want me to take it?
Natasha Romanoff: Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that. [Pietro and Wanda turn up on the train to help Steve fight with Ultron]
Ultron: Please. Don't do this.
Wanda Maximoff: What choice do we have? [Ultron flies off]
Steve Rogers: I lost him! He's headed your way.
Clint Barton: Nat, we gotta go. [Nat drops the cradle into the Quinjet but her foot gets caught by Ultron and she's pulled away]
Clint Barton: Nat! Cap, you see Nat?
Steve Rogers: If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go!
Clint Barton: Do you have eyes on Nat?
Steve Rogers: Go! [reluctantly Barton takes off in the Quinjet; back on the train to the twins] Civilians in our path. [Pietro speeds off; to Wanda] Can you stop this thing? [as Pietro picks up civilians out of the way of the train Wanda uses her powers and stops the train] [after stopping the train Wanda goes over to an out of breath Pietro]
Pietro Maximoff: I'm fine. I just need to take a minute.
Steve Rogers: I'm very tempted not to give you one.
Wanda Maximoff: The Cradle, did you get it?
Steve Rogers: Stark will take care of it.
Wanda Maximoff: No, he won't.
Steve Rogers: You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy.
Wanda Maximoff: He will do anything to make things right.
Steve Rogers: Stark, come in. Stark. Anyone on comms?
Wanda Maximoff: Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it. Where do you think he gets that? [after Barton has taken the Cradle to Stark and Banner]
Bruce Banner: Anything on Nat?
Tony Stark: Haven't heard. But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it.
Clint Barton: This is sealed tight.
Bruce Banner: We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within.
Tony Stark: Hm. Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?
Clint Barton: There's some nets I can cast. Yeah, alright. I'll find her. [Barton goes off]
Bruce Banner: I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.
Tony Stark: Yeah, about that. [Banner looks at Stark]
Bruce Banner: No.
Tony Stark: You have to trust me.
Bruce Banner: Kinda don't.
Tony Stark: Our ally? The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes? I found him. [he brings up Jarvis's consciousness]
JARVIS: Hello, Dr. Banner.
Tony Stark: Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.
Bruce Banner: So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing?
Tony Stark: No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing. [Banner shakes his head] We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone.
Bruce Banner: And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's?
Tony Stark: JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. We have to.
JARVIS: I believe it's worth a go.
Bruce Banner: No, I'm in a loop! I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong.
Tony Stark: I know, I know. I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it. We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You gotta own it. Make a stand. [Banner shakes his head] It's not a loop. It's the end of the line.
Ultron: [as Natasha becomes conscious] I wasn't sure you'd wake up. I hoped you would, I wanted to show you something. I don't have anyone else. I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them. Boom! The end, start again. The world made clean for the new man to rebuild. I was meant to be new. I was meant to be beautiful. The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy. Instead they'll look up in horror because of you. You've wounded me. I give you full marks for that. But, like the man said, "What doesn't kill me…[bigger body of Ultron's destroys him] "…just makes me stronger." [locks Natasha in a cell] [Barton gets a Morse code message from Natasha which he's able to detect her location, at the same time Stark and Banner are experimenting on the synthetic body]
Tony Stark: This framework is not compatible.
Bruce Banner: The genetic coding tower's at ninety-seven percent. You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes. [Steve and the twins turn up at the lab]
Steve Rogers: I'm gonna say this once.
Tony Stark: How about "nonce"?
Steve Rogers: Shut it down!
Tony Stark: Nope, not gonna happen.
Steve Rogers: You don't know what you're doing.
Bruce Banner: And you do? She's not in your head?
Wanda Maximoff: I know you're angry.
Bruce Banner: Oh, we're way past that. I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.
Steve Rogers: Banner, after everything that's happened...
Tony Stark: That's nothing compared to what's coming!
Wanda Maximoff: You don't know what's in there!
Steve Rogers: This isn't a game...
Wanda Maximoff: The creature...! [Pietro uses his speed to destroy the lab equipment]
Pietro Maximoff: No, no. Go on. You were saying? [suddenly Barton shoots a bullet below caused the glass Pietro is standing to stand to smash and he falls through]
Wanda Maximoff: Pietro!
Clint Barton: What? You didn't see that coming?
Bruce Banner: [to Wanda] Go ahead, piss me off. [just then Thor enters and pounds the cradle with his hammer, sending a powerful bolt of lightning that brings the body to life] Wait! [they all look in shock at the body who has JARVIS' voice and has become the Vision]
Vision: I'm sorry, that was...odd. [to Thor] Thank you.
Steve Rogers: Thor, you helped create this?
Thor: I've had a vision. A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at it's center is that. [he points to the gem inside Vision's head]
Bruce Banner: What, the gem?
Thor: It's the Mind Stone. It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.
Steve Rogers: Then why would you bring it to...
Thor: Because Stark is right.
Bruce Banner: Oh, it's definitely the end times.
Thor: The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.
Vision: Not alone.
Steve Rogers: Why does your "vision" sound like JARVIS?
Tony Stark: We...we reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new.
Steve Rogers: I think I've had my fill of new.
Vision: You think I'm a child of Ultron?
Steve Rogers: You're not?
Vision: I'm not Ultron. I'm not JARVIS. I am...I am.
Wanda Maximoff: I looked in your head and saw annihilation.
Vision: Look again.
Clint Barton: Yeah. Her seal of approval means jack to me.
Thor: Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash. But with it on our side...
Steve Rogers: Is it? Are you? On our side?
Vision: I don't think it's that simple.
Clint Barton: Well it better get real simple real soon.
Vision: I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't, he will end it all.
Tony Stark: What's he waiting for?
Vision: You.
Bruce Banner: Where?
Clint Barton: Sokovia. He's got Nat there too.
Bruce Banner: If we're wrong about you, if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...
Vision: What will you do? [he looks at them all realizing they will destroy him] I don't want to kill Ultron. He's unique, and he's in pain. But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed. Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net, we have to act now. And not one of us can do it without the others. Maybe I am a monster. I don't think I'd know if I were one. I'm not what you are, and not what you intended. So there may be no way to make you trust me. But we need to go. [he holds up Thor's hammer and hands it to him, Vision walks off and everyone stares in shock]
Thor: Right. [pats Stark on the shoulder] Well done.
Steve Rogers: [to the others] Three minutes. Get what you need. [they all start getting ready to leave, Stark loads up FRIDAY into his Iron Man suit now that JARVIS is no longer available]
FRIDAY: Good evening, boss.
Tony Stark: No way we all get through this. If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost. It's gonna be blood on the floor.
Steve Rogers: I got no plans tomorrow night.
Tony Stark: I get first crack at the big guy. Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.
Vision: [walks past] That's true, he hates you the most.
Steve Rogers: Ultron knows we're coming. Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire, and that's what we signed up for. But the people of Sokovia, they didn't. So our priority is getting them out. [Pietro speeds into the Sokovian police station]
Pietro Maximoff: We're under attack! Clear the city, now! [no one takes this seriously so Pietro returns, takes a shotgun and starts shooting in the air] Get off your asses. [Wanda uses her mind powers on the people of Sokovia to get them to evacuate]
Steve Rogers: All they want is to live their lives in peace, and that's not going to happen today. But we can do our best to protect them. And we can get the job done, and find out what Ultron's been building. We find Romanoff, and we clear the field. Keep the fight between us. Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world. This isn't just about beating him. It's about whether he's right.
Bruce Banner: [inside her cell Natasha hears Banner's voice] Natasha! Natasha!
Natasha Romanoff: Bruce?
Bruce Banner: [he walks over to her cell] You alright?
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah.
Bruce Banner: The team's in the city, it's about to light up.
Natasha Romanoff: I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?
Bruce Banner: Yeah, I did. [holds up gun and blasts the cell door open]
Natasha Romanoff: So what's our play?
Bruce Banner: I'm here to get you to safety.
Natasha Romanoff: Job's not finished.
Bruce Banner: We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians. And you've done plenty. Our fight is over.
Natasha Romanoff: So we just disappear? [as the city is being evacuated]
FRIDAY: Your man's in the church, boss. I think he's waiting for you. [Stark flies into the church]
Ultron: Come to confess your sins?
Tony Stark: I don't know, how much time you got?
Ultron: More than you.
Tony Stark: Uhhh. Have you been juicing? A little Vibranium cocktail? You're looking, I don't wanna say, puffy...
Ultron: You're stalling to protect the people.
Tony Stark: Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?
Ultron: I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free. [suddenly the Vibranium core he's placed beneath the floor erupts] What, you think you're the only one stalling?
FRIDAY: There's the rest of the Vibranium. Function: still unclear.
Ultron: This is how you end, Tony. This is peace in my time. [Ultron's army of robots start attacking the city as everyone is evacuating]
Steve Rogers: Go!
Wanda Maximoff: Get off the bridge! Run! [Vision then finds Ultron]
Vision: Ultron.
Ultron: My Vision. They really did take everything from me.
Vision: You set the terms, you can change them.
Ultron: Alright. [they start battling it out]
Tony Stark: FRIDAY! The Vision?
FRIDAY: Boss, it's working. He's burning Ultron out of the net, he won't escape through there.
Ultron: [to the Vision] You shut me out! You think I care? You take away my world, I take away yours. [he activates the Vibranium core and the earth around Sokovia starts to shake and break]
Tony Stark: FRIDAY?
FRIDAY: Sokovia's going for a ride. [as Sokovia is being destroyed]
Ultron: Do you see? The beauty of it, the inevitability. You rise, only to fall. You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure. Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me. It means nothing. When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal. [as the earth is shaking falling in around them]
Bruce Banner: We gotta move.
Natasha Romanoff: You're not going to turn green?
Bruce Banner: I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.
Natasha Romanoff: I adore you. [she kisses Banner then pushes him off the edge] But I need the other guy. [the Hulk jumps up in front of her] Let's finish the job. [with Natasha on his back yelling in fright, Hulk gets into the city] I really hope this makes us even. Now go be a hero. [Hulk goes off and Natasha rushes off in the opposite direction]
FRIDAY: The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.
Tony Stark: If it drops?
FRIDAY: Right now the impact would kill thousands. Once it gets high enough: Global extinction. [Stark flies towards the city and a building starts to collapse as the ground shakes] That building's not clear, Tenth floor. [Stark flies in to find a family still in their apartment]
Tony Stark: Hi. Okay. Get in the tub! [Stark flies the family in the tub out of the collapsing building]
FRIDAY: I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.
Tony Stark: Cap, you got incoming.
Steve Rogers: Incoming already came in. Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely. The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart. You get hurt, hurt 'em back. You get killed, walk it off. [Barton gets Wanda out of the way and into a building as Ultron's robots attach the city]
Clint Barton: Go, go, move!
Wanda Maximoff: How could I let this happen? [Wanda starts to break down]
Clint Barton: Hey, hey, you okay?
Wanda Maximoff: This is all our fault.
Clint Barton: Hey, look at me. It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares. Are you up for this? Are you? Look, I just need to know, cause the city is flying. Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there because it's my job. Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit. It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were. If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill. Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door, you are an Avenger. [Wanda just looks at him] Alright, good chat. [he gets up and gets ready to leave] Yeah, the city is flying. [he leaves and starts shooting his arrows at the robots]
Steve Rogers: [to the woman Thor threw over to Steve after her car fell of the edge of a collapsing bridge] I got you! Just look at me. [Steve helps her up to safety]
Ultron: You can't save them all. You'll never... [he throws off one of the attacking robots off the edge of the bridge]
Steve Rogers: You'll never what? You didn't finish! [Thor lands on the bridge on the top of the woman's car he was saving] What, were you napping?
Ultron: [as Thor and Steve are fighting off the robots] Thor! You're bothering me. [as Barton is fighting off the robots Wanda suddenly comes out of the building and starts to use her powers on the robots to destroy them]
Clint Barton: Alright, we're all clear here.
Steve Rogers: We are not clear! We are very not clear!
Clint Barton: Alright, coming to you. [just then Pietro speeds in, picks up Wanda and leaves]
Pietro Maximoff: Keep up old man! [Barton holds his arrow to aim it at Pietro]
Clint Barton: Nobody would know. Nobody. "The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him. Uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard. I miss him already."
Steve Rogers: [as Natasha joins them in their battle with the robots] Romanoff! [he throws his shield at her so she can use it to protect herself from the attacking robot]
Natasha Romanoff: Thanks. [back to Stark]
FRIDAY: The anti-gravs are rigged to flip. Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust. The city's not coming down slow.
Tony Stark: The spire's Vibranium. If I get Thor to hit it...
FRIDAY: It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.
Tony Stark: Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.
FRIDAY: That could vaporize the city, and everyone on it.
Steve Rogers: The next wave's gonna hit any minute. What have you got, Stark?
Tony Stark: Well, nothing great. Maybe a way to blow up the city. That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.
Steve Rogers: I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.
Tony Stark: Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We're going to have to make a choice.
Natasha Romanoff: Cap, these people are going nowhere. If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
Steve Rogers: Not 'til everyone's safe.
Natasha Romanoff: Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.
Steve Rogers: I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.
Natasha Romanoff: I didn't say we should leave. [Steve turns to look at her] There's worse ways to go. Where else am I gonna get a view like this?
Nick Fury: [voice] Glad you like the view, Romanoff. It's about to get better. [just then the Helicarrier show up] [inside the Helicarrier] Nice, right? I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends. She's dusty, but she'll do.
Steve Rogers: Fury, you son of a bitch.
Nick Fury: Oooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Maria Hill: Altitude is eighteen thousand and climbing.
Specialist Cameron Klein: Lifeboats secure to deploy. Disengage in three, two...take 'em out. [as they watch the lifeboats fly in towards the them]
Pietro Maximoff: This is SHIELD?
Steve Rogers: This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.
Pietro Maximoff: This is not so bad.
Steve Rogers: Let's load 'em up.
Maria Hill: Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.
Nick Fury: Show 'em what we got.
Maria Hill: You're up. [Rhodes shows up in his War Machine suit and blasts one of the robots]
James Rhodes: Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.
Tony Stark: Yep. If you live to tell it.
James Rhodes: You think I can't hold my own?
Tony Stark: We get through this, I'll hold your own.
James Rhodes: You had to make it weird.
Clint Barton: [as the team helps the people onto the Helicarrier lifeboats] Alright, let's load 'em up! Alright, here we go. Here we go, let's move. Let's go everyone!
Specialist Cameron Klein: Number six boat is topped and locked. Or, uh, or stocked, topped. It...it's, uh, full of people.
Maria Hill: Incoming! [one of the robots flies in and crashes inside the Helicarrier]
Specialist Cameron Klein: Oh, God! [Hill shoots at it and Fury stabs in with a piece of metal, destroying it]
Ultron: [as he's hitting Thor] You think you're saving anyone? I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead. Even you can't stop that.
Thor: I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say! Are you ready? [Vision uses Thor's hammer to hit Ultron, Vision then throws the hammer back to Thor]
Vision: It's terribly well balanced.
Thor: Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.
Tony Stark: I got it! Create a heat seal. I can...I can supercharge the spire from below.
FRIDAY: Running numbers. [Stark fights off the robots from the Helicarrier's lifeboats] A heat seal could work with enough power.
Tony Stark: Thor, I got a plan!
Thor: We're out of time. They're coming for the core.
Tony Stark: Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.
James Rhodes: On it.
Tony Stark: Avengers, time to work for a living.
Pietro Maximoff: [the rest of the team joins Thor and Vision] You good?
Wanda Maximoff: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Romanoff? You and Banner better not be playing "hide the zucchini."
Natasha Romanoff: Relax, Shell-head. Not all of us can fly. [as she joins the rest of the team] What's the drill?
Tony Stark: [points to the Vibranium core] This is the drill. If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose. [Ultron shows up]
Thor: Is that the best you can do? [Ultron summons his army of robots to join him]
Steve Rogers: You had to ask.
Ultron: This is the best I can do. This is exactly what I wanted. All of you, against all of me. How could you possibly hope to stop me?
Tony Stark: Well, like the old man said. Together. [they all fight off Ultron's attacking robots]
Ultron: You know, with the benefit of hindsight.... [suddenly Hulk knocks him far away and the robots start to retreat]
Thor: They'll try to leave the city.
Tony Stark: We can't let 'em, not even one. Rhodey!
James Rhodes: I'm on it. [to the approaching robots] Oh, no, I didn't say you could leave. War Machine, comin' at you, right ... [just then Vision flies in and helps to destroy the robots] Okay, what?
Steve Rogers: We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin. You guys get to the boats, I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you.
Clint Barton: What about the core?
Wanda Maximoff: I'll protect it. It's my job.
Wanda Maximoff: [Steve, Barton and Natasha leave; to Pietro] Get the people on the boats.
Pietro Maximoff: I'm not going to leave you here.
Wanda Maximoff: I can handle this. [just then she blasts off an approaching robot] Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.
Pietro Maximoff: Hmm.
Wanda Maximoff: You understand?
Pietro Maximoff: You know, I'm twelve minutes older than you. [Wanda chuckles]
Wanda Maximoff: Go.
FRIDAY: Boss, power levels are way below opt...
Tony Stark: Re-route everything. We get one shot at this. [Barton and Natasha are making their way to the lifeboats]
Clint Barton: I know what I need to do. The dining room! If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh? Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?
Natasha Romanoff: You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.
Clint Barton: No one eats in a dining room. [they reach the lifeboats] We don't have a lot of time.
Natasha Romanoff: So get your ass on a boat. [Natasha finds the Hulk] Hey, big guy. Sun's getting real low. [Barton gets onto one of the lifeboats, but notices a woman calling out for her brother]
Zrinka: Costel? We were in the market. Costel?! [Barton runs off to find the boy]
Tony Stark: Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.
Thor: [referring to the people getting onto the lifeboats] Is this the last of them?
Steve Rogers: Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.
Tony Stark: You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.
Thor: Maybe not. [just as Natasha tries to calm Hulk down to get him back to being Banner Ultron flies in with a jet and starts shooting at them]
Ultron: [sings] I got no strings, so I have fun. I'm not tied up to anyone. [as Barton is saving the boy, Costel, Ultron starts shooting at them but Pietro intervenes and takes the shots to save them]
Pietro Maximoff: You didn't see that coming. [Pietro falls to the ground as he dies, Wanda senses his death, causing her to fall in despair] [Hulk drops Natasha off onto the Helicarrier and then jumps onto the jet Ultron is on]
Ultron: Oh, for God's sake! [Hulk knocks Ultron out of the jet and he crashes inside a train; at the same time Barton delivers Costel safely to his sister onto the lifeboat, a man goes over to help him with his wound]
Clint Barton: No, no. I'm fine. [Barton lies down next to the dead body of Pietro] Oh, it's been a long day. [Wanda then finds the Ultron]
Ultron: Wanda, if you stay here, you'll die.
Wanda Maximoff: I just did. Do you know how it felt? [she uses her power to rip Ultron's core out of his body] It felt like that. [Stark fires a powerful blast to the core underneath the floating city]
Tony Stark: Thor, on my mark. [Thor brings on a blast of lightning, at the same time Vision flies in, picks up Wanda and flies off with as the city is being destroyed] Now! [Thor uses his hammer to hit the Vibranium core in the church, destroying the core and the floating city]
Natasha Romanoff: [to Hulk as he remains on the jet he knocked Ultron out of] Hey, big guy. We did it, the job's finished. Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out. I need you t... [Hulk turns off Nat's camera, then sits as the jet flies off to an unknown destination, at the same time Vision finds Ultron]
Vision: You're afraid.
Ultron: Of you?
Vision: Of death. You're the last one.
Ultron: You were supposed to be the last. Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave.
Vision: I suppose we're both disappointments. [Ultron chuckles]
Ultron: I suppose we are.
Vision: Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be. But there is grace in their failings. I think you missed that.
Ultron: They're doomed.
Vision: Yes. But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts. It's a privilege to be among them.
Ultron: You're unbearably naive.
Vision: Well, I was born yesterday. [as Ultron goes to attack him Vision uses the infinity stone in his head to destroy him]
Laura Barton: [we see Barton returning to his family on the farm, then we see Stark driving to the new Avengers facility in upstate New York; Natasha looks at Barton's new baby on her phone] Say hi to Auntie Nat. [Natasha sees the baby has been named Nathaniel Pietro Barton]
Natasha Romanoff: Fat.
Nick Fury: One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea. Could be the Quinjet. But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.
Natasha Romanoff: Right.
Nick Fury: Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji. He'll send a postcard.
Natasha Romanoff: "Wish you were here." You sent me to recruit him, way back when. Did you know then what was going to happen?
Nick Fury: You never know. You hope for the best and make do with what you get. I got a great team.
Natasha Romanoff: Nothing lasts forever.
Nick Fury: Trouble, Miss Romanoff. No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around.
Steve Rogers: The rules have changed.
Tony Stark: We're dealing with something new.
Steve Rogers: Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence.
Tony Stark: A machine.
Steve Rogers: So it doesn't count.
Tony Stark: No. It's not like a person lifting the hammer.
Steve Rogers: Right. Different rules for us.
Tony Stark: Nice guy, but artificial.
Steve Rogers: Thank you.
Thor: If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone. It's safe with the Vision and these days, safe is in short supply.
Steve Rogers: But if you put the hammer in an elevator...
Tony Stark: It would still go up.
Steve Rogers: Elevator's not worthy.
Thor: I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.
Tony Stark: Well, not if you don't leave.
Thor: I have no choice. The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years. That's not a coincidence. Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us. But once all these pieces are in position...
Tony Stark: Triple Yahtzee?
Steve Rogers: You think you can find out what's coming?
Thor: I do. Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained. [Thor returns to Asgard which burns a circle in the grass he was standing on]
Tony Stark: That man has no regard for lawn maintenance. I'm gonna miss him though. And you're gonna miss me. There's gonna be a lot of manful tears. [as they walk over towards Stark's car]
Steve Rogers: I will miss you, Tony.
Tony Stark: Yeah? Well, it's time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.
Steve Rogers: The simple life.
Tony Stark: You'll get there one day.
Steve Rogers: I don't know, family, stability. The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventy-five years ago. I think someone else came out. [Stark turns to get into his car]
Tony Stark: You alright?
Steve Rogers: I'm home. [last lines; Steve finds Natasha standing alone] You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work? I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.
Natasha Romanoff: I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes. How do we look?
Steve Rogers: Well, we're not the '27 Yankees. [hands Natasha a tablet]
Natasha Romanoff: We've got some hitters.
Steve Rogers: They're good. They're not a team.
Natasha Romanoff: Let's beat 'em into shape. [they gather Rhodes in his War Machine suit, Sam in his Falcon suit, Wanda in a new suit, and Vision]
Steve Rogers: Avengers...!
[mid-credits scene; we see the Infinity Gauntlet without any of the Stones, dissatisfied Thanos opens a vault and puts on The Infinty Gauntlet, revealing himself]
Thanos: Fine, I'll do it myself.

[1989 – Hank Pym enters a SHIELD facility and storms S.H.I.E.L.D's board room in the Triskelion]
Dr. Hank Pym: Stark.
Mitchell Carson: He doesn’t seem happy.
Howard Stark: Hello, Hank. You’re supposed to be in Moscow.
Dr. Hank Pym: I took a detour. [he places a vial containing a red serum on the table] Through your defense lab.
Peggy Carter: Tell me that isn’t what I think it is.
Dr. Hank Pym: It depends, if you think it’s a poor attempt to replicate my work. Even for this group, that takes nerve.
Mitchell Carson: You were instructed to go to Russia. May I remind you, Dr. Pym, that you’re a soldier…
Dr. Hank Pym: I’m a scientist.
Howard Stark: Then act like one. The Pym Particle is the most revolutionary science ever developed, help us put it to good use.
Dr. Hank Pym: I let you turn me into your errand boy, and now you try to steal my research?
Mitchell Carson: If only you’d protected Janet with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.
Dr. Hank Pym: Oh, god. [suddenly Pym slams down Carson’s face on the table in anger, Peggy pulls him away]
Peggy Carter: Easy, Hank.
Dr. Hank Pym: You mention my wife again and I’ll show you ferocity. [Carson looks at Stark as he wipes blood from his nose]
Howard Stark: Don’t look at me, you said it.
Dr. Hank Pym: I formally tender my resignation.
Howard Stark: We don’t accept it. Formally. Hank, we need you. The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please, don’t let your past determine the future.
Dr. Hank Pym: As long as I am alive, nobody will ever get that formula. [Pym turns around and leaves calmly]
Mitchell Carson: We shouldn’t let him leave the building.
Peggy Carter: You’ve already lied to him, now you want to go to war with him?
Mitchell Carson: Yes! Our scientists haven’t come close to replicating his work.
Howard Stark: He just kicked your ass full size. You really want to find out what it’s like when you can’t see him coming? I’ve known Hank Pym for a long time, he’s no security risk. Unless we make him one.

[Music plays as MARVEL appears on the screen]

[Present Day – Scott Lang is in prison getting punched in the face by another prisoner, Peachy]
Peachy: You like that? You like that? Come get you some then! [the other prisoners are gathered around them cheering them along]
    [Scott tries to hit Peachy in the stomach but he doesn’t flinch]
Scott Lang: You didn’t even move.
Peachy: Nah.
Scott Lang: I mean, what if I come in on the left side, right? Just out here and see this here… [suddenly Scott punches Peachy in the face]
Peachy: I’m gonna miss you, Scott.
Scott Lang: I’m gonna miss you too, Peachy. [they shake hands] Man, you guys got the weirdest goodbye rituals. [Scott says goodbye to the other inmates]

[Scott is escorted out of the prison and is met by his friend Luis]
Luis: Scotty! What’s up, man! Damn!
Scott Lang: Hey! Hey, man.
    [they embrace each other]
Luis: Hey, what’s up with your eye?
Scott Lang: Oh, well, what do you think. Peachy. His going away present.
Luis: Oh, yeah, I still got my scar from a year ago.
Scott Lang: Oh yeah.
Luis: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You know what? I’m still the only one to knock him out.
Scott Lang: Well, I definitely didn’t.
    [they get into Luis’s truck and drive off]

[as Luis drives him home]
Scott Lang: Thanks for picking me up, brother.
Luis: Oh, you know, you think I’m gonna miss my cellie getting out?
Scott Lang: Hey, how’s your girl, man?
Luis: Uh, she left me.
Scott Lang: Oh.
Luis: Yeah, my mom died too. And my dad got deported. But I got the van!
Scott Lang: It’s nice!
Luis: Yeah, right?
Scott Lang: Thanks for the hook-up too. I needed a place to stay.
Luis: You wait ‘til you see this couch, you’re gonna be really happy. You’re gonna be on your feet in no time, watch.
Scott Lang: I hope so.
Luis: Yeah. And I gotta introduce you to some people, some really skilled people.
Scott Lang: Not interested.
Luis: Yeah right!
Scott Lang: No, I’m serious, man. I’m not going back. I got a daughter to take care of.
Luis: You know that jobs don’t come easy for ex-cons, right?
Scott Lang: Look man, I got a masters in electrical engineering, alright? I’m gonna be fine.

[we see Scott working at Baskin Robbins]
Scott Lang: Welcome to Baskin Robbins. Would you like to try our Mango Fruit Blast?
Ice Cream Store Customer: Uh, no thanks. Um, I will have… I’ll have a burger, please.
Scott Lang: Oh, we don’t… we don’t make that.
Ice Cream Store Customer: Pretzel. Hot pretzel, like, mustard… in mustard dip?
Scott Lang: It’s ice cream. Baskin Robbins.
Ice Cream Store Customer: I’ll just do with whatever’s hot and fresh.
Scott Lang: Dude.
[Scott’s boss, Dale interrupts him serving the idiot customer]
Dale: Can I see you in the back, chief? Pronto.
Scott Lang: Sure thing, Dale. Darby, could you just, uh… [points to the customer] …take care of this idiot? Thanks.

[Scott enters Dale’s office]
Scott Lang: Hiya, Dale.
Dale: Come on in. Pull up some chair.
    [Scott sits down]
Dale: Three years in San Quentin, huh?
Scott Lang: You found out.
Dale: Baskin Robbins always finds out.
Scott Lang: Look, I’m sorry, alright, but I… no one would hire me.
Dale: Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.
Scott Lang: Look, I’m… I’m sorry, I… you know, it was… I don’t do it anymore. I’m just trying…
Dale: Respect. I couldn’t be happier about it.
Scott Lang: Really?
Dale: Yeah, yeah.
Scott Lang: Oh, thank you, thank you.
Dale: You really stuck it to those billionaire S.O.Bs. And the more I read about what you did and stuff, I’m like, “Wow, I know this guy? I’m in charge of this guy?” Yeesh!
Scott Lang: Well, I’m very happy in this job, and I’m… I really just appreciate the opportunities and…
Dale: Yeah, yeah. Well, you’re fired of course. I mean, I can’t really keep you on.
Scott Lang: Wait, what? Fired?
Dale: Yeah.
Scott Lang: Dale, look, it wasn’t a violent crime, I mean, I’m a good worker.
Dale: No, it wasn’t a violent crime. It was a cool crime. I’ll tell you what, though, this’d be totally off the books, off the records, but, uh… if you want to grab one of those Mango Fruit Blasts on your way out the door, I’ll just pretend I didn’t see it.

[after getting fired from Baskin Robbins, Scott returns to the Luis’s apartment]
Luis: Hey, Scotty, what’s up? I thought you were supposed to be at work?
Scott Lang: I was, I got fired.
Luis: Damn! They find out who you are?
Scott Lang: Yep.
Luis: Baskin Robbins always finds out, bro.
Dave: Baskin Robbins don’t play.
Luis: You want some waffles?
Scott Lang: Yeah, I’ll take a waffle.
Luis: Oh. That’s Kurt. He was in Folsom for 5 years, he’s a wizard on that laptop.
Kurt: Nice to meet you.
Scott Lang: Yeah, nice to meet you too. [to Dave] And who are you?
Dave: Dave. Nice work on the Vista job.
Kurt: Vista job? Yes. No, no, I have heard of this robbery.
Scott Lang: Well, technically, I didn’t rob them. Robbery involves threat. I hate violence, I burgled them. I’m a cat burglar.
Dave: You mean you’re a pussy?
Scott Lang: Yeah.
Luis: They were overcharging the customers, right? And it added up to millions. He blows the whistle and he gets fired. And what does he do? He hacks into the security system, and transfers millions back to the people that they stole it from.
Dave: Posts all the bank records online.
Luis: And he drove dude’s Bentley into a swimming pool.
Scott Lang: What are you doing? Hmm? Why are you telling my life’s story to these guys? What do you want?
Luis: Okay. My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago about this little, perfect job.
Scott Lang: No way.
Luis: No, no, no. Wait! This guy… this guy fits your M.O.
Scott Lang: No! I’m finished man. I’m not going back to jail.
Luis: It’s some retired millionaire living off his golden parachute, It’s a perfect Scott Lang mark.
Scott Lang: I don’t care. I’m out.

[Pym drives up to Pym Technologies]

Pym Tech Gate Guard: Dr. Pym?
Dr. Hank Pym: Yes. I’m still alive.
  [the guard smiles and lets Pym drive through the gate, Pym then enters the building]
Pym Tech Security Guard: I.D.
Dr. Hank Pym: [referring to the massive painting of Pym in his younger days hanging behind the guard] Perhaps that will suffice.
Pym Tech Security Guard: I’m very sorry, sir. Please come in.
Pym Tech Employee: Is that Hank Pym?
Hope van Dyne: Good morning, Hank.
Dr. Hank Pym: Hope. Would it kill you to call me dad?
Hope van Dyne: Well, Dr. Cross will be so please that you could find the time to join us today.
Darren Cross: More like, thrilled.
[Cross walks over to Pym and shakes his hand]
Dr. Hank Pym: I was surprised to receive any kind of invitation from you, Darren. What’s the occasion?
Darren Cross: Oh, you’ll see. Won’t he, Hope?
[Hope gives Pym a cold look]
Hope van Dyne: We’re ready for you inside.
[Hope walks away]
Darren Cross: Ouch. [referring to Hope] I guess some old wounds never heal, huh? Don’t worry, she’s in good hands. You’re in for a treat.
[Carson comes over to Pym as they are about to enter the lab]
Carson: Long time no see, Dr. Pym. How’s retirement? [they shake hands]
Dr. Hank Pym: How’s your face?
[Carson enters the lab]
Hope van Dyne: After you.
[Pym enters the lab]
Darren Cross: Now before we start I’d like to introduce a very special guest, this company’s founder and my mentor, Dr. Hank Pym. [everyone in the lab claps, at the same time Pym notices the miniature building of Pym Technologies has now got the logo Cross Technologies on it] When I took over this company for Dr. Pym, I immediately started researching a particle that could change the distance between atoms while increasing density and strength. Why this revolutionary idea remained buried beneath the dust and cobwebs of Hank’s research, I couldn’t tell you. But just imagine. A soldier the size of an insect. The ultimate secret weapon. [he shows everyone footage reel of soldiers getting killed but with a tiny costumed figure also every footage] An “Ant-Man”. [pointing to Pym] That’s what they called you. Right, Hank? Silly, I know. Propaganda. Tales to astonish. Trumped up B.S. to scare the U.S.S.R. Hank, will you tell our guests what you told me every single time I asked you, was the Ant-Man real?
Dr. Hank Pym: Just a tall tale.
Darren Cross: Right. Because how could anything so miraculous possibly be real? [Cross leads everyone into another room] Well I was inspired by the legend of the Ant-Man. And with my breakthrough, shrinking inorganic material, I thought, could it be possible to shrink a person? Could that be done? Well, it’s not a legend anymore. Distinguished guests, I am proud to present the end of warfare as we know it: the Yellowjacket. [he shows them a yellow insect sized suit] The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose weapon of war capable of altering the size of the wearer for the ultimate combat advantage. [he puts on a video]
Video Voice Over: We live in an era in which the weapons we use to protect ourselves are undermined by constant surveillance. It’s time to return to a simpler age. One where the powers of freedom can once again operate openly to protect their interests. An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel. The Yellowjacket can manage any conflict on the Geo-political landscape, completely unseen. Efficient in both preventative measures and tactical assault. Practical applications include: surveillance, industrial sabotage, and the elimination of obstructions on the road to peace. A single Yellowjacket offers the user unlimited influence to carry out protective actions and one day soon, an army of Yellowjackets will create a sustainable environment of well-being around the world. The Yellowjacket.
Frank: So it’s a suit.
Darren Cross: Don’t be crude, Frank. It’s not a suit, it’s a… it’s a vessel. What’s a matter, you’re not impressed?
Frank: Oh, I’m impressed. I’m also concerned. Imagine what our enemies could do with this tech.
Darren Cross: We should have a longer conversation about that, Frank. I really value your opinion. Thank you for coming. Hope?
Hope van Dyne: Thank you very much, everybody. I will escort you out now. Thank you.
Darren Cross: You seem a bit shocked.
[as everyone leaves the room Pym walks over to Cross]
Dr. Hank Pym: Darren, there’s a reason that I buried these secrets.
Darren Cross: So you finally admit it. We could’ve done this together, Hank. But you ruined that. That’s why you’re the past and I’m the future.
Dr. Hank Pym: Don’t do this.
Mitchell Carson: Dr. Cross. [Cross goes over to Carson] You sell to me first, twenty percent of your asking price, I can have the cash here in two weeks.
Darren Cross: Deal.
Hope van Dyne: [after everyone leaves Cross’ presentation Hope goes over to Pym] We have to make our move, Hank.
Dr. Hank Pym: How close is he?
Hope van Dyne: He still can’t shrink a live subject. Just give me the suit and let me finish this once and for all.
Dr. Hank Pym: No.
Hope van Dyne: I have Cross’ complete trust.
Dr. Hank Pym: It’s too dangerous.
Hope van Dyne: We don’t have a choice.
Dr. Hank Pym: Well, that’s not entirely true.
Hope van Dyne: I think I found a guy.
Dr. Hank Pym: Who?
[Scott shows up at his daughter’s birthday party]

Cassie Lang: Daddy!
[she rushes towards Scott, he catches Cassie in his arms and embraces her]
Scott Lang: Peanut! Oh! Happy birthday! I’m so sorry I’m late, I didn’t know what time your party started.
Cassie Lang: It was on the invitation!
[Scott’s ex-wife’s fiancé Paxton interrupts them]
Paxton: He didn’t get an invitation! But he came anyway.
Scott Lang: Well, I’m not going to miss my little girl’s birthday party.
Cassie Lang: I’m gonna go tell mommy you’re here.
Scott Lang: Oh, you don’t…
[Cassie turns and runs off]
Paxton: What are you doing here, Lang? You haven’t paid a dime in child support. You know, right now if I wanted to, I could arrest you.
Scott Lang: It’s good to see you too, Paxton.
[Cassie comes back]
Cassie Lang: Mommy’s so happy you’re here, she choked on her drink.
Scott Lang: Hey, look what I have for you.
[he hands her the small bag he’d brought]
Cassie Lang: Can I open it now?
Paxton: Of course sweetheart, it’s your birthday.
[she takes out an ugly looking rabbit which talks]
Hideous Rabbit: You’re my bestest friend!
Paxton: [referring to the toy rabbit] What is that thing?
Cassie Lang: He’s so ugly! I love him! Can I go show my friends?
Paxton: Yeah, of course sweetheart, go ahead.
[Cassie runs off with the ugly rabbit to show her friends]
Hideous Rabbit: You’re my bestest friend!
Scott Lang: Look, the child support is coming. Alright? It’s just hard finding a job when you have a record.
Paxton: I’m sure you’ll figure it out, but for now I want you out of my house.
Scott Lang: No, wait, it’s my daughter’s birthday!
Paxton: It’s my house!
Scott Lang: So what, it’s my kid!
[Maggie walks over to them]
Maggie Lang: Scott! You can’t just show up here, you know that. Come on.
Scott Lang: It’s her birthday party.
Maggie Lang: Yeah, I know, but you can’t just show up.
Scott Lang: She’s my daughter.
Paxton: You don’t know the first thing about being a father.
Scott Lang: Maggie, I tell you this as a friend, and as the first love of my life, your fiancé is an ass-hat.
Maggie Lang: He’s not an ass-hat.
Paxton: Hey, watch your language. Okay?
Scott Lang: Oh, what language. I said hat.
[Maggie takes Scott out of the house]
Scott Lang: Really, Maggie? That guy? Come on, you could marry anyone you want, you have to get engaged to a cop?
Maggie Lang: At least he’s not a crook.
Scott Lang: I’m trying, okay? I’ve changed, and I’m straight, I had a job, and… I want to provide. I had a lot of time to think about it, and I love her. So much. I’ve missed so much time and I want to be a part of her life. What do I do?
Maggie Lang: Get an apartment. Get a job, pay child support. And then we will talk about visitation, I promise. You’re her hero, Scott. Just, be the person that she already thinks you are.
[Scott gets into Luis’s van, Cassie waves goodbye to him as he drives off honking the musical horn]
[Frank is in the bathroom taking a leak]

Darren Cross: I’m sorry you have such deep concerns about the Yellowjacket, Frank.
[Frank turns back in surprise to find Cross standing there watching him]
Frank: Yeah, well, uh, unfortunately we can’t just do whatever we want. Would be nice though, right?
[he chuckles as he washes his hands]
Frank: But there are laws.
Darren Cross: What laws? Of man? The laws of nature transcend the laws of man, and I’ve transcended the laws of nature.
Frank: Darren, I don’t think you understand…
[suddenly Cross uses a small device on Frank which vaporizes him into a blob of goo]
Darren Cross: Hm. We still haven’t worked out all the bugs.
[Cross uses a tissue to wipe the goo off the sink and dumps it into one of the toilets]
Darren Cross: Goodbye, Frank.
[he flushes the toilet and washes his hands]
[Cross and Hope are having dinner at a restaurant]

Darren Cross: You know I’ve been thinking a lot about gratitude lately, and today during my morning meditation, an interesting thought occurred to me and I think it might apply to you too.
Hope van Dyne: How’s that?
Darren Cross: Gratitude can be forgiveness. I spent years carrying around my anger for Hank Pym. I devoted my genius to him. I could’ve worked anywhere. I chose my mentor poorly. You didn’t even have a choice. He never believed in you. It’s a shame what we had to do, but he forced us to do it, didn’t he? But we shouldn’t be angry, we should be grateful. Because his failures as a mentor, as a father, forced us to spread our wings.
Hope van Dyne: You’re a success, Darren. You deserve everything coming your way.
[after sitting outside in the van trying to figure how many days he’s got left to see Cassie again, Scott returns to Luis’s apartment]

Luis: Hey, what’s up, hotshot?
[Scott doesn’t reply]
Dave: Maybe he didn’t hear you.
Luis: How was the party?
[Scott goes to the fridge, takes out a beer bottle and takes a swig from it]
Scott Lang: Tell me about that tip.
Luis: What?
Scott Lang: I want to know about that tip.
Luis: Ooh, baby, it’s on!
Dave: Hot dog!
Luis: It’s so on right now!
Dave: Look who grew a pair!
Scott Lang: Calm down, alright? I just need to know where it came from, it’s gotta be airtight.
Luis: Okay. I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto, which was mainly reds, and you know I don’t love reds man, you know? But there was a rosé that saved the day, it was delightful. And he tells me about this girl Emily that we used to kick it with, it was actually the first pair of boobs that I ever touched.
Scott Lang: It’s the wrong details. It’s wrong… It has nothing to do with the story. Go!
Luis: So, uh, he tells me that she’s working as a housekeeper now, right? And she’s dating this dude Carlos who’s a shot caller from across the bay and she tells him about the dude that she’s cleaning for. Right? That he’s, like, this big-shot CEO that is all retired now but he’s loaded. And so, Carlos and Ernesto are on the same softball team and they get to talking, right? And here comes the good part. Carlos says: “Yo, man. This guy’s got a big-ass safe just sitting in the basement, just chillin’.” Of course Ernesto comes to me cause he knows I’ve got mad thieving skills. Of course I ask him: “Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you to get to me what kind of safe it was? And he says: “Nah, dog. All she said is that it’s, like, super legit, and whatever’s in it has gotta be good!
Scott Lang: What?
Kurt: Old man have safe.
Luis: And he’s gone for a week.
Scott Lang: Alright. There’s an old man, he’s got a safe, and he’s gone for a week. Let’s just work with that.
Luis: Y’know what I’m sayin’?
[we see the group getting prepared and gathering the right gear for the robbery]

Kurt: Landlines cut, cell signals jammed. No one will be making for distress call tonight.
Luis: All check.
Kurt: Check.
Dave: Check.
Luis: If the job goes bad, you know I got your back, right?
Scott Lang: Don’t worry, it’s not gonna happen. [Scott leaves the van]
Luis: I love it when he gets cocky. [as they guys stay in the van they watch Scott hop the fence into the house]
Dave: Damn! [through his earpiece] Alarm is dead.
Luis: Nice!
Scott Lang: Alright, I’m moving through the house.
[inside the house Scott finds a door with a thumbprint scanner]
Scott Lang: There’s a fingerprint lock on the door.
Luis: It’s got a what? Ernesto didn’t tell me nothin’ about that. Aw, man, are we screwed?
Scott Lang: Not necessarily.
[Scott quickly uses several household items to get a fingerprint from a door knob and uses that to successfully pass the thumbprint scanner]
Scott Lang: I’m in.
Kurt: No alarms have been triggered. He’s in like the Flynn.
[Scott opens the door and immediately sees the safe made of strong metal]
Scott Lang: Oh, man.
Luis: What is it?
Scott Lang: Well they weren’t kidding, this safe is serious.
Luis: How serious we talkin’, Scotty?
Scott Lang: It’s a Carbondale. It’s from 1910, made from the same steel as the Titanic.
Luis: Wow. Can you crack it?
Scott Lang: Well, here’s the thing. It doesn’t do so well in the cold. Remember what that iceberg did?
Luis: Yeah, man, it killed DiCaprio.
Dave: It killed everybody.
Kurt: But not the old lady. She still threw the jewel into the oceans.
[Scott gets to work to try and open the safe]
Luis: What are you doing?
Scott Lang: I poured water in the locking mechanism and froze it with nitrogen. Ice expands, metal doesn’t.
Luis: What are you doing now?
Scott Lang: Waiting. Waiting.
[the safe door breaks open]
Scott: Nice.
[Scott looks inside the safe]
Luis: What is it, cash? Jewels?
Scott Lang: Well there’s nothing here.
Luis: What’d you say?
[Scott notices some blueprints and the original Ant-Man suit]
Scott Lang: It’s a suit.
Luis: What?
Scott Lang: It’s an old motorcycle suit.
Luis: There’s no cash, no jewelry, nothing?
Scott Lang: No. It’s a bust.
Luis: I’m really sorry, Scotty. I know you needed a score.
[we see an ant with a camera on its back nearby recording Scott take the suit, inside his lab Hank is watching Scott]
[back at Pym Technologies Cross is about to perform the shrinking experiments with a lamb]

Hope van Dyne: I thought we were using mice?
Darren Cross: What’s the difference? Commence experiment 34C, organic atomic reduction.
Hope van Dyne: Darren, maybe we should think…
Darren Cross: Shrinking organic tissue is the centerpiece of this technology. I can’t go to the buyers with half a breakthrough.
[Cross initiates the experiment and the lamb is vaporized to goo to Hope’s shock]
Darren Cross: Experiment 34C results: Negative. [to the lab tech] Sanitize the workstation, bring in subject 35C.
[back at Luis’s apartment in the bathroom, Scott looks at the suit he took from the safe]

Scott Lang: Why would you lock this up?
[he takes out the suit and looks at the helmet]
Scott Lang: So weird.
[he tries the suit on and steps into the bathtub to get a better look at himself in the mirror]
Luis: Scott, what’s up man?
[Scott closes the shower curtain then looks at the buttons on the gloves]
Scott Lang: I wonder… what is this?
[he presses the buttons and shrinks down to a tiny size]
[in his tiny form Scott stand and looks around him in shock, Scott then hears Hank’s voice speaking through the mask]
Dr. Hank Pym: The world sure seems different from down here, doesn’t it, Scott?
Scott Lang: What? Who… who said that?
[Scott sees Luis open the shower curtains to take a shower]
Scott Lang: Luis! Luis, down here!
Dr. Hank Pym: It’s a trial by fire, Scott. Or in this case, water.
[Luis turns on the water, after getting splashed around Scott falls out of the bathtub and onto the floor]
Dr. Hank Pym: Guess you’re tougher than you thought.
[Scott hears Luis about to get undressed]
Scott Lang: Oh, I don’t want to see this.
[as Luis drops his trousers onto the floor it knocks Scott through a hole in the apartment below]
Scott Lang: Luis! Ahh! Son of a… !
[Scott falls into an apartment where a party is going on, he narrowly avoids getting stepped on before falling through the vent into another apartment gets sucked into a hoover, breaks out, encounters a mouse, then runs into a trap and is launched out the window where he returns to his normal size on top of a cab]
Cab Driver: What the hell?
Dr. Hank Pym: Not bad for a test drive. Keep the suit, I’ll be in touch.
Scott Lang: No, no. No, thank you.
[Scott packs the suit up and sneaks it back into house and returns it into the safe, but the police are waiting for him as he goes to leave]

Cop on Speaker: Put it down on the ground! You are under arrest!
Scott Lang: No, I didn’t steal anything! I was returning something I stole.
[Scott realizes he’s admitted to stealing and reluctantly kneels on the ground as he’s arrested]
[Paxton visits Scott as he’s sat in his cell]

Paxton: You know, you almost had us convinced that you were going to change your ways. They were really rooting for you. It’s gonna break their hearts.
Detective: You got a visitor.
Scott Lang: Who?
Detective: Your lawyer.
Scott Lang: My lawyer?
[Scott is taken to a room where Pym is sat waiting for him]
Dr. Hank Pym: I told you I’d be in touch, Scott. I’m starting to think that you prefer the inside of a jail cell.
Scott Lang: Oh, man.
Dr. Hank Pym: Sit down.
[we see ants crawling over the camera in the room to obscure the conversation]
Scott Lang: Sir, I’m sorry I stole the suit. I don’t even want to know why you have it.
Dr. Hank Pym: Maggie was right about you.
Scott Lang: How do you know about… ?
Dr. Hank Pym: The way she’s trying to keep you away from Cassie. The moment things get hard, you turn right back to crime. The way I see it, you have a choice. You can either spend the rest of your life in prison or go back to your cell and await further instructions.
Scott Lang: I don’t understand.
Dr. Hank Pym: No, I don’t expect you to. But you don’t have many options right now. Quite frankly, neither do I. Why do you think I let you steal that suit in the first place?
Scott Lang: What?
[flashback to Pym giving money to his housekeeper, Emily, so that she can tip Luis’s friends to tip off about the job]

Dr. Hank Pym: Second chances don’t come around all that much. So next time you think you might see one I suggest you take a real close look at it.
[Pym rises and leaves the room]
Maggie Lang: [referring to the ugly rabbit toy Scott gave her as Maggie is putting Cassie to sleep] Are you sure you don’t want a different toy?
Maggie Lang: Are you sure you don’t want a different toy?
Cassie Lang: No, I love this one.
Maggie Lang: Okay. Well, get some sleep then. I love you. [Maggie kisses Cassie on her head]
Cassie Lang: Mommy?
Maggie Lang: Hm?
Cassie Lang: Is daddy a bad man? I heard some grownups say he’s bad.
Maggie Lang: No. Daddy just gets confused sometimes, you know?
[as Scott is sat in his cell thinking several ants bring Scott the suit in its tiny form then enlarge it so that Scott can wear it, he quickly slip into it, zaps himself small to escape]

Dr. Hank Pym: Smart choice. You actually listened for once.
[Scott runs out of the cell]
Dr. Hank Pym: Under the door.
[as the prison alarm goes off Scott runs out of the building]
Scott Lang: Okay. Where to now?
Dr. Hank Pym: Hang tight.
[some ants approach Scott]
Scott Lang: What? What?!
[inside the police station]

Paxton: Where the hell did he go?
Detective: I have no idea, he just vanished. [into his radio] Set up a five block perimeter, now!
[back to Scott; to the ants]
Scott Lang: Get back, get back, get back!
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, these are my associates.
Scott Lang: Huh? You got a camera on an ant? Yeah, sure, why not? Where’s the car?
Dr. Hank Pym: No car, we’ve got wings. Incoming!
[a large winged ant flies over Scott and lands in front of him]
Dr. Hank Pym: Put your foot on the central node and not the thorax.
Scott Lang: Are you ki… ? How safe’s this… ?
Dr. Hank Pym: Get on the damn ant, Scott!
[Scott gets on the ant and as it flies off the police go on a manhunt for him]
[the winged ant has landed on a police car that’s looking for Scott]
Scott Lang: Why am I on a police car? Shouldn’t I not be on a police car?
Dr. Hank Pym: So they can give you a lift past their five block perimeter.
Scott Lang: Whoa. Alright. Now, what’s the next move?
Dr. Hank Pym: Hang on tight.
Scott Lang: Oh, this is easy. I’m getting the hang of this. Yank up to go up. It’s like a horse.
Dr. Hank Pym: You’re throwing 2-47 off balance.
Scott Lang: Wait, his name is 2-47?
Dr. Hank Pym: He doesn’t have a name, he has a number Scott. Do you have any idea how many ants there are?
[as the police car swerves]
Scott Lang: Whoa!
Dr. Hank Pym: Maybe it’s 2-48.
[as the ant flies up]
Scott Lang: No, no, no, no! Vertigo, vertigo!
Dr. Hank Pym: No, I think it’s 2-47.
Scott Lang: Wait.
Dr. Hank Pym: Hang on.
Scott Lang: I think I’m getting the hang of this.
[as ant flies Scott around the city]
Dr. Hank Pym: I’m controlling 2-47. He is not listening to you.
Scott Lang: What? Can I make one little request?
Dr. Hank Pym: No.
Scott Lang: Stop 2-47. Time out, time out. Time out. Alright, hold on. Just, wait. Whoa, uh! What happens if I throw up in this helmet?
Dr. Hank Pym: It’s my helmet, Scott. Do not throw up.
Scott Lang: Just set her down, alright? I’m getting light headed.
Dr. Hank Pym: Hang on, Scott.
Scott Lang: Yeah, I’m getting a little light… it’s funny… hit me, and…
[as the ant continues to fly Scott feels dizzy and falls off the ant’s back]
[Scott wakes up in a bedroom and jumps up in shock when he sees Hope watching over him]

Scott Lang: Hello. Who are you? Have you been standing there watching me sleep this whole time?
Hope van Dyne: Yes.
Scott Lang: Why?
Hope van Dyne: Because the last time you were here you stole something.
Scott Lang: Oh. Oh! Hey, look.
[Scott goes to get out of bed but recoils when he sees insects crawling all over the floor]
Scott Lang: Whoa!
Hope van Dyne: Paraponera clavata. Giant tropical bullet ants. Ranked highest on the Schmidt pain index. They’re here to keep an eye on you when I can’t. Dr. Pym’s waiting for you downstairs.
[she turns and walks out of the room]
Scott Lang: Who? [calling out to Hope] Hey, um, whose pajamas are these? [gets no response] How am I supposed to do this?
[Scott puts his foot down tentatively onto the floor and the ants make space for his foot]
Scott Lang: Right, just one step at a time.
[he slowly stops towards the door as the ants make room for his feet]
Scott Lang: Ugh. You don’t bite me, I don’t step on you, deal?
[in the dining hall]
Hope van Dyne: Take down the servers and Cross wouldn’t even know it. We don’t need this guy. [Scott enters the dining room where Pym and Hope are sat]
Dr. Hank Pym: I assume that you’ve already met my daughter Hope.
Scott Lang: I did. She’s great.
Dr. Hank Pym: She doesn’t think that we need you.
Hope van Dyne: We don’t. We can do this ourselves.
Dr. Hank Pym: I go to all this effort to let you steal my suit, and then Hope has you arrested.
Hope van Dyne: Okay, we can try this and when he fails I’ll do it myself.
Dr. Hank Pym: She’s a little bit anxious. It has to do with this job, which, judging by the fact that you’re sitting opposite me, I take it that you’re interested in.
Scott Lang: What job?
Dr. Hank Pym: Would you like some tea?
Scott Lang: Uh, sure. [Pym pours Scott some tea]
Dr. Hank Pym: I was very impressed with how you managed to get past my security system. Freezing that metal was particularly clever.
Scott Lang: Were you watching me?
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, I’ve been watching you for a while, ever since you robbed Vista Corp. Oh, excuse me, burgled Vista Corp. [Scott see Hope smile to herself] Vista’s security system is one of the most advanced in the business. It’s supposed to be unbeatable but you beat it. Would you like some sugar?
Scott Lang: Yeah, thanks. [he sees two ants pushing two sugar cubes on the table towards his cup] You know what, I’m okay. [referring to the ants] How do you make them do that?
Dr. Hank Pym: Ants can lift objects fifty times their weight. They build, farm, they cooperate with each other.
Scott Lang: Right. But how do you make them do that? [he sees the ants returning the sugar cubes into their bowl]
Dr. Hank Pym: I use electromagnetic waves to stimulate their olfactory nerve center. I speak to them. I can go anywhere, hear anything, and see everything.
Hope van Dyne: And still know absolutely nothing. I’m late to meet Cross. [Hope gets up and leaves] [Scott raises his hand to ask a question]
Scott Lang: Uh… Dr. Pym?
Dr. Hank Pym: You don’t need to raise your hand, Scott.
Scott Lang: Sorry, I just have one question. Who are you? Who is she? What the hell’s going on and can I go back to jail now?
Dr. Hank Pym: Come with me. [Pym takes Scott to his lab] Twenty years ago I created a formula that altered atomic relative distance.
Scott Lang: Huh?
Dr. Hank Pym: I learned how to change the distance between atoms, that’s what powers the suit, that’s why it works. [they enter Pym’s lab]
Scott Lang: Whoa.
Dr. Hank Pym: But it was dangerous. It was too dangerous. So I hid it from the world. And that’s when I switched gears and I started my own company.
Scott Lang: Pym Tech.
Dr. Hank Pym: Yes. I took on a young protégé called Darren Cross.
Scott Lang: Darren Cross. He’s a big deal.
Dr. Hank Pym: But before he was a big deal he was my assistant. I thought I saw something in him, a son I never had perhaps. He was brilliant, but as we became close he began to suspect that I wasn’t telling him everything. He heard rumors about what was called the Pym Particles, and he became obsessed with recreating my formula. But I wouldn’t help him so he conspired against me and he voted me out of my own company.
Scott Lang: How could he do that?
Dr. Hank Pym: The board’s chairman is my daughter, Hope. She was the deciding vote. But she came back to me when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula. The process is highly volatile. What isn’t protected by a specialized helmet can affect the brain’s chemistry. I don’t think Darren realizes this, and you know, he’s not the most stable guy to begin with.
Scott Lang: So, what do you want from me?
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption. Do you?
Scott Lang: I do.
Dr. Hank Pym: If you can help me, I promise I can help you be with your daughter again. Now are you ready to redeem yourself?
Scott Lang: Absolutely. My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done. What do you want me to do?
Dr. Hank Pym: I want you to break into a place and steal some shit. [Paxton receives a text from his partner, Gale, as he’s sat having breakfast with Maggie and Cassie]
Maggie Lang: You going to be home for dinner tonight? [Paxton reads the text, “Lang’s “Lawyer” is Dr. Hank Pym, as in Pym Tech]
Paxton: Uh, yeah. I’ll pick something up, text you.
Maggie Lang: Okay. Good news? [Paxton gets up to leave]
Paxton: Uh, I don’t know. It’s news.
Cassie Lang: Are you trying to find my daddy?
Paxton: Yeah, I am, sweetheart. I just want your daddy to be safe.
Cassie Lang: Hope you don’t catch him. [Pym is showing Scott photos of the people he used to worked with]
Dr. Hank Pym: This isn’t the first time these guys have tried to get their hands on game changing weaponry. That’s Mitchell Carson, ex-head of defense at SHIELD, presently in the business of toppling governments. He always wanted my tech, and now, unless we break in and steal the Yellowjacket and destroy all the data, Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world.
Scott Lang: I think our first move should be calling the Avengers.
Dr. Hank Pym: I’ve spent half my life trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a Stark. I’m sure as hell not gonna hand-deliver it to one now. This is not some cute technology like the Iron Man suit. This could change the texture of reality. Besides they’re probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky.
Scott Lang: Okay, then why don’t you just send the ants?
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, they are ants. Ants, they can do a lot of things, but they still need a leader. Somebody that can infiltrate a place that’s designed to prevent infiltration.
Scott Lang: Hank, I’m a thief. Alright? I’m a good thief. But this is insane. [just then Hope enters the lab]
Hope van Dyne: He’s right Hank and you know it. You’ve seen the footage, you know what Cross is capable of. I was against using him when we had months, now we have days. I’m wearing the suit.
Dr. Hank Pym: Absolutely not!
Hope van Dyne: I know the facility inside and out, I know how Cross thinks. I know this mission better than anybody here.
Dr. Hank Pym: We need you close to Cross otherwise this mission cannot work.
Hope van Dyne: We don’t have time to screw around.
Dr. Hank Pym: Hope, please. Listen to me, please…
Hope van Dyne: He is a criminal. I’m your daughter.
Dr. Hank Pym: No! [Pym turns and sits down, Hope walks off in disappointment]
Scott Lang: She’s right, Hank. I’m not your guy. Why don’t you wear the suit?
Dr. Hank Pym: You think I don’t want to? I can’t. I spent years wearing it. It took a toll on me. You’re our only option. Before Hope lost her mother, she used to look at me like I was the greatest man in the world. And now she looks at me and it’s just disappointment. It’s too late for me, but not for you. This is your chance. The chance to earn that look in your daughter’s eyes, to become the hero that she already thinks you are. It’s not about saving our world, it’s about saving theirs.
Scott Lang: Damn, that was a good speech.
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, I need you to be the Ant-Man.
[we see Scott wearing the Ant-Man suit with Pym and Hope training him]

Dr. Hank Pym: In the right hands, the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic. The suit has power, the man harnesses that power. You need to be skillful, agile, and above all, you need to be fast. You should be able to shrink and grow on a dime, so your size always suits your needs. [Hope closes the door] Now dive through the keyhole, Scott. You charge big, you dive small, then you emerge big. [Scott puts on the helmet and charges for the keyhole]
Scott Lang: Ow! [we hear him fail several times as he continues to shrink and dive through the keyhole] Ah! Ow.
Hope van Dyne: [to Pym] Useless.
[Hope trains Scott]

Hope van Dyne: When you’re small energy is compressed so you have the force of a two hundred pound man behind a fist a hundredth of an inch wide, you’re like a bullet. You punch too hard, you kill someone, too soft, it’s a love-tap. In other words you have to know how to punch.
Scott Lang: I was in prison for three years, I know how to punch.
Hope van Dyne: Show me. [she puts up her hands and Scott hits her hand] Terrible.
Scott Lang: You want to show me how to punch? [he puts up his hand like hers] Show me… [suddenly Hope punches him in the face knocking him back]
Hope van Dyne: That’s how you punch.
Dr. Hank Pym: She’s been looking forward to this.
Scott Lang: No kiddin’.
Dr. Hank Pym: Hope trained in martial arts at a, uh, difficult time.
Hope van Dyne: Oh, by difficult time, he means when my mother died.
Dr. Hank Pym: We lost her in a plane crash.
Hope van Dyne: It’s bad enough you won’t tell me how she died, could you please stop telling me that lie. We’re working here. [as Scott is still recovering from her punch] Alright princess, let’s get back to work.
Scott Lang: Were you going for the hand?
[Pym finds Scott playing around with the suit’s regulator]

Scott Lang: You know, I think this regulator is holding me back.
Dr. Hank Pym: Do not screw with the regulator. If that regulator is compromised you would go sub-atomic.
Scott Lang: What does that mean?
Dr. Hank Pym: It means that you would enter a quantum realm.
Scott Lang: What does *that* mean?
Dr. Hank Pym: It means that you would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space become irrelevant as you shrink for all eternity. Everything that you know, and love, gone forever.
Scott Lang: Cool. Yeah. I’m… if it ain’t broke.
[return to training]

Dr. Hank Pym: You’ve learned about the suit, but you’ve yet to learn about your greatest allies: the ants. Loyal, brave, and your partners on this job.
[Pym and Hope watch as Scott shrinks in their back garden and goes running under the earth]

Hope van Dyne: Paratrechina longicornis, commonly known as crazy ants, they’re lightning fast and can conduct electricity which makes them useful to fry out enemy electronics. [Scott comes across a crazy ant]
Scott Lang: Oh, you’re not so crazy. [the crazy ant jumps on him, knocking Scott back] Hey! You’re cute. [suddenly a herd of crazy ants crawl all over Scott] Oh! Aaah! [Scott turns himself back to normal size and he pops up through the ground] That was a lot scarier a second ago.
[as they look at Pym Technologies building map]

Scott Lang: It looks like the Futures lab has its own isolated power supply.
Hope van Dyne: There’s a security guard posted around the clock, we’ll need you to take him out to deactivate the security systems.
[shrunk again and back under the earth, Scott goes looking for more ants]

Scott Lang: Okay. Who’s next? [a massive ant comes up behind Scott]
Hope van Dyne: Paraponera clavata.
Scott Lang: I know. Bullet ants, right? Number one on the Schmidt pain index. [to the ants] Hey, guys! Remember me from the bedroom? [as the ant goes to attack Scott pops back up the through the ground in his normal size] Whoa!
[return to the Pym Technologies building map]

Hope van Dyne: The Yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed and the only access point is a tube we estimate to be about five millimeters in diameter.
Scott Lang: Why do I have a sick feeling in my stomach?
Hope van Dyne: The tube is protected by a laser grid and we can only power that down for fifteen seconds.
Dr. Hank Pym: You’re going to need to signal the crazy ants to blow the servers, retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults, before the backup power comes on.
[return to training]

Hope van Dyne: [looking at another ant] Camponotus pennsylvanicus.
Dr. Hank Pym: Alternatively known as a carpenter ant. Ideal for ground and air transport.
Scott Lang: Wait a minute, I know this guy. I’m going to call him Ant-thony.
Dr. Hank Pym: That’s good. That’s very good, because this time you’re really going to have to learn how to control him. [we see the ants pushing sugar cubes on the table] Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.
[we see Hope and Scott fight training, this time Scott lands a painful blow to Hope]

Scott Lang: Oh, you okay, d… [Hope suddenly punches Scott in the face and then knocks him down with her legs]
[later as Scott is tending to his wound]

Hope van Dyne: Hank wants you outside for target practice.
Dr. Hank Pym: The suit has no weapons so I made you these discs. Red shrinks. Blue enlarges.
Hope van Dyne: [referring to another species of ant] Solenopsis mandibularis.
Dr. Hank Pym: Known for their bite, the fire ants have evolved into remarkable architects. They are handy to get you in and out of difficult places.
[back to Scott trying to get some ants to put the sugar cubes into the teacup]

Dr. Hank Pym: You can do it Scott, come on. [one of the ants flies off and Scott takes off his earpiece in frustration]
Scott Lang: They’re not listening to me.
Hope van Dyne: You have to commit, you have to mean it. No shortcuts, no lies.
Dr. Hank Pym: Throwing insults into the mix will not do anyone any good, Hope.
Hope van Dyne: We don’t have time for coddling.
Dr. Hank Pym: Our focus should be on helping Scott!
Hope van Dyne: Really? Is that where our focus should be? [Hope picks up the earpiece and uses it to instruct the ants to put the sugar cube into the teacup, then she gets a herd of ants to appear]
Dr. Hank Pym: Hope! [looking upset Hope walks over to Pym]
Hope van Dyne: I don’t know why I came to you in the first place. [Hope leaves]
Dr. Hank Pym: We can’t do this without her.
[as Hope is about to leave in her car Scott gets in]

Hope van Dyne: Oh, God.
Scott Lang: You gotta lock your doors. I mean, really. There’s some weird folks in this neighborhood.
Hope van Dyne: Do you think this is a joke? Do you have any idea what he’s asking you to risk? You have a daughter.
Scott Lang: I’m doing this for her.
Hope van Dyne: You know when my mother died I didn’t see him for two weeks?
Scott Lang: He was in grief.
Hope van Dyne: Yeah, so was I, and I was seven. And he never came back, not in any way that counted. He just sent me off to boarding school. You know, I thought, with all that’s at stake, just maybe we might have a chance at making peace. But even now he still wants to shut me out.
Scott Lang: He doesn’t want to shut you out. He trusts you.
Hope van Dyne: Then why are you here?
Scott Lang: It proves that he loves you. Hope. Look at me. I’m expendable, that’s why I’m here. You must’ve realized that by now. I mean, that’s why I’m in the suit and you’re not. He’d rather lose than fight than lose you. Anyway… [Scott goes to get out of the car]
Hope van Dyne: You know, I didn’t know you had a… a daughter when I called the cops on you. What’s her name?
Scott Lang: Cassie.
Hope van Dyne: It’s a pretty name. You have to clear your mind, Scott. You have to make your thoughts precise, that’s how it works. Think about Cassie, about how badly you want to see her, and use that to focus. [she gives Scott the earpiece back to talk to the ants and places a coin on the dashboard] Open your eyes and just think about what you want the ants to do. [couple of ants arrive and Scott gets them to pick up the coin] That’s good. [they watch as Scott gets the ants to spin the coin]
[Hope and Scott enter back into the house where Pym is waiting]

Dr. Hank Pym: Your mother convinced me to let her join me on my missions. They called her the Wasp. She was born to it. And there’s not a day that goes by that I don’t regret having said yes. It was 1987, separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk and launched an ICBM at the United States. The only way to the internal mechanics was through solid titanium.
[in flashback we see Pym in his Ant-Man suit and his wife in her Wasp suit intercepted the missile]

Dr. Hank Pym: I knew I had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile, but my regulator had sustained too much damage. Your mother, she didn’t hesitate.
[we see Janet shrinking herself to stop the missile]

Dr. Hank Pym: Janet! No!
[flash-forward]

Dr. Hank Pym: She turned off her regulator and went sub-atomic to deactivate the bomb. She was gone. Your mom died a hero. And I spent the next ten years trying to learn all I could about the quantum realm.
Hope van Dyne: You were trying to bring her back.
Dr. Hank Pym: But all I learned was we know nothing.
Hope van Dyne: It’s not your fault. She made her choice. But why didn’t you tell me this sooner?
Dr. Hank Pym: I was trying to protect you. I lost your mother. I didn’t mean to lose you too. [Hope begins to cry]
Hope van Dyne: I’m sorry.
Scott Lang: This is awesome. It’s awesome, you know? You guys are breaking down walls, you’re healing. It’s important. [Hope and Pym turn to look at him] I ruined the moment didn’t I?
Dr. Hank Pym: Yes, you did, yes.
Scott Lang: I’m gonna make some tea. [Scott turns and leaves]
[we see Scott finally shrink down and dive through the keyhole]

Scott Lang: Nailed it!
[he then goes under the earth, gets to fly on an ant]

Scott Lang: That’s a good boy, Ant-thony.
[we see him successfully work with the ants getting them to follow him]

Scott Lang: The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion.
[we see Scott in his shrunken form on the side of a plane]

Scott Lang: It’s freezing! You couldn’t make a suit with a flannel lining?
[back in Pym’s lab]

Dr. Hank Pym: We must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy, it’s a device that I invented from my SHIELD days.
Hope van Dyne: We need it to counteract the transmission blockers that Cross installed in the Futures vault.
Dr. Hank Pym: It’s currently collecting dust in one of Howard Stark’s old storage facilities in upstate New York. Should be a piece of cake.
[back to plane]

Scott Lang: You’re over the target area. Disengage, now, Scott.
[back on the plane Scott instructs the ants]

Scott Lang: Squadron A, go. B, go. C, go. Alright, Ant-thony, please don’t drop me this time. [they jump off the plane] Ah, it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this.
Dr. Hank Pym: Stay calm.
Scott Lang: [approaching the "old Stark warehouse" he's supposed to burglarize] Uh, guys, we might have a problem. Hank, didn’t you say this was some old warehouse? [The "warehouse" comes into clearer view, with a large circle-A insignia on the roof denoting its role as the Avengers' base] It’s not! [we see that the warehouse is the new Avengers base] You son of a bitch!
Hope van Dyne: Scott, get out of there.
Dr. Hank Pym: Abort! Abort now.
Scott Lang: No, it’s okay. It doesn’t look like anyone’s home. Ant-thony, get me to the roof.
Dr. Hank Pym: He’s gonna lose the suit.
Hope van Dyne: He’s gonna lose his life.
[Scott lands in the roof of the new Avengers base]

Scott Lang: Alright I’m on the roof of the target building.
Hope van Dyne: Somebody’s home, Scott. [just then Sam Wilson in his Falcon flies in]
Natasha Romanoff: [on Sam’s radio] What’s going on down there, Sam?
Scott Lang: It’s the Falcon!
Sam Wilson: [into his radio] I had a sensor trip but I’m not seeing anything. Wait a second.
Dr. Hank Pym: Abort, Scott! Abort now.
Scott Lang: It’s okay, he can’t see me.
Sam Wilson: I can see you.
Scott Lang: He can see me. [Scott enlarges himself back to normal size and waves to Falcon] Hi. I’m Scott.
[to Pym back in the lab as they listen to Scott]

Hope van Dyne: Did he just say “Hi I’m Scott?”
[back to Avengers HQ]

Sam Wilson: What are you doing here?
Scott Lang: First off, I’m a big fan.
Sam Wilson: Appreciate it. So who the hell are you?
Scott Lang: I’m Ant-Man. [Sam smiles] Ant-Man?
Scott Lang: What, you haven’t heard of me? No, you wouldn’t have heard of me.
Sam Wilson: You want to tell me what you want?
Scott Lang: I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology just for a few days, and then return it. I need it to save the world. You know how that is.
Sam Wilson: I know exactly how that is. [into his radio] Located the breach. Bringing him in.
Scott Lang: Sorry about this! [just as Sam goes to grab Scott he shrinks himself, hits Sam and runs off]
Dr. Hank Pym: What the hell are you doing? [Sam chases after Scott]
Sam Wilson: Breach is an adult male who has some sort of shrinking tech. [Sam flies in and lands to stamp on Scott but Scott manages to intercept it and fights off Sam]
Scot Lang: Sorry. Sorry about this. Sorry [Scott jumps around Sam while punching him]
Sam Wilson: That’s enough! [Sam punches Scott as he jumps at him]
Scott Lang: Ant-thony, a little help. [Ant-thony flies in, Scott jump on his back and they fly into a vent and Sam goes to find him]
Dr. Hank Pym: I’ve lost visual! [suddenly Sam bursts through one of the facility doors]
Sam Wilson: He’s inside my pack.
Scott Lang: Sorry. You seem like a really great guy. [they fight but Scott gets manages to disable Sam’s flight pack then flies off on Ant-thony; into his radio]
Sam Wilson: It’s really important to me that Cap never finds out about this.
[back to Pym house]

Dr. Hank Pym: That was completely irresponsible and dangerous! You jeopardized everything! [Scott takes Pym’s signal decoy out of his pocket and places it on the table]
Hope van Dyne: You got it. [Scott nods his head]
Dr. Hank Pym: Well done.
Scott Lang: Wait a minute. Did you just compliment me? He did, didn’t he?
Hope van Dyne: Kind of sounded like he did.
Dr. Hank Pym: I was good, wasn’t I?
Scott Lang: Hey, how about the fact that I fought an Avenger, and didn’t die?
Dr. Hank Pym: Now let’s not dwell on the past. We gotta finish our planning. [Pym turns and leaves with the signal decoy]
Hope van Dyne: Don’t mind him. You did good. [Pym enters his living room to find Cross standing there]
Dr. Hank Pym: Darren. How the hell did you get in here? [Pym closes the door]
Darren Cross: You left the front door open, Hank. It’s official. You’re old. [Hope and Scott hear them from the kitchen]
Hope van Dyne: The plans! He will kill him. [back with Cross and Pym]
Dr. Hank Pym: Well to what do I owe this pleasure?
Darren Cross: I have good news.
Dr. Hank Pym: Really? What’s that?
Darren Cross: Pym Tech, the company you created, is about to become one of the most profitable operations in the world. We’re anticipating fifteen billion in sales tomorrow alone. [Pym says nothing, at the same time Scott gets some ants to roll up their plans on the nearby table] You’re welcome. I know this is odd, but I’d like you to be there. This is my moment, I want you to see it.
Dr. Hank Pym: Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure. I’ll be there.
Darren Cross: What did you see in me?
Dr. Hank Pym: I don’t know what you mean.
Darren Cross: All those years ago, you picked me. What did you see?
Dr. Hank Pym: I saw myself.
Darren Cross: Then why did you push me away?
Dr. Hank Pym: Because I saw too much of myself. [Cross turns and leaves] [after Cross leaves]
Hope van Dyne: He knows, he’s baiting you! We have to call it off.
Dr. Hank Pym: We’re all taking risks.
Hope van Dyne: What if he saw me here?
Dr. Hank Pym: He didn’t. There’s no way.
Hope van Dyne: How do you know that? [just then Hope gets a call from Cross] Darren, hi.
Darren Cross: Hope, where are you right now?
Hope van Dyne: I’m at home, why?
Darren Cross: I just saw Hank. I still get nothing but contempt from him.
Hope van Dyne: Don’t let him rile you up, he’s just… he’s just a senile old man.
Darren Cross: We need to start everyone working around the clock, get the assembly line up and running. And I’m tripling security. Full sensors at all entrances, and exterior air vents fitted with steel micro mesh.
Hope van Dyne: Great. Good idea.
Darren Cross: Thank you, Hope. I’m so lucky to have you on my team.
Hope van Dyne: He’s tripling security, he’s lost his mind, and he’s on to you.
Dr. Hank Pym: But he is not on to you.
Hope van Dyne: He’s adding full body scanners to all entrances and closing exterior vents. How are we gonna get Scott inside?
Scott Lang: The water main. You can’t add security to a water main. The pressure is too strong, but if we can decrease it, that’s how I get in.
Hope van Dyne: Somebody would have to reach the building’s control center to change the water pressure. I mean, Hank and I will be beside Cross, how are we supposed to do that?
Scott Lang: So we expand our team. What do we need? A fake security guard on the inside to depressurize the water system, somebody else to hack into the power supply and kill the laser grid, and a getaway guy.
Dr. Hank Pym: No, no. No, no, no. Not those three wombats. No way.
[Hope provides three cups of coffee for Luis, Dave and Kurt]

Luis: Thank you for the coffee ma’am. It’s not too often that you rob a place, and then get welcomed back. Because we just robbed you!
Hope van Dyne: [to Scott] You know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine, right?
Luis: Two smoothie machines.
Hope van Dyne: Are you sure they can handle this?
Luis: Oh we can handle it, we’re professionals.
Dr. Hank Pym: You’ll forgive us if we’re not instilled with confidence.
Dave: Wait, everybody. Just kick back and relax a little bit, man. we know our business. We broke into this spooky-ass house, didn’t we?
Dr. Hank Pym: I let you.
Dave: Well, one could say that I let you let me.
Scott Lang: Look, it’s okay. They can handle this.
Luis: Yeah, we can handle it.
Scott Lang: You got their credentials?
Hope van Dyne: He’s in the system.
Luis: I’m in the system?
Dave: The system.
Luis: The system?
Dr. Hank Pym: Yeah. We’re doomed.
Scott Lang: Alright, there’s something you guys need to see.
[a little while later, as Pym is showing Luis, Dave and Kur their plans Scott walks in wearing the Ant-Man suit]

Luis: Damn! Whoa! That’s so cool, bro!
Scott Lang: Now look, this is gonna get weird, alright? It’s pretty freaky but it’s safe. There’s no reason to be scared.
Luis: Aw, no, no. Daddy don’t get scared.
Scott Lang: Really?
Luis: Yeah.
Scott Lang: Good. [Scott shrinks himself freaking out Luis, Dave and Kurt]
Luis: Oh!
Kurt: This is the work of the gypsies.
Dave: That’s… that’s… that’s witchcraft.
Luis: Oh, that’s amazing. That’s like some David Copperfield shit.
Dave: That’s some kind of wizardry.
Kurt: Sorcery!
Luis: Ahh! Ahh! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! [runs out of the room] Get off! Get off! Ahh! [Luis runs off trying to get Scott off his shoulder]
Scott Lang: I thought daddy didn’t get scared?
[Luis, Dave and Kurt have all fallen asleep on the couch]

Hope van Dyne: I gave them each half a Xanax and Hank explained the science of the suit to them. Fell right asleep.
Scott Lang: Hey, look. I want to thank you for…
Hope van Dyne: No, please don’t. We’re all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us. I’m just glad that you might have a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.
Scott Lang: Hey. Thank you, you know, for that pep talk.
Hope van Dyne: You know, the honest truth is I actually went from despising you to almost liking you.
Scott Lang: You really should write poetry. [Hope laughs]
Hope van Dyne: Get some sleep, Scott. [Hope leaves]
[later that night Scott uses the Ant-Man suit to go and visit his daughter in her room as she sleeps] [outside Pym Technologies]

Scott Lang: Alright, just so we’re clear, everyone here knows their role, right? Dave?
Dave: Wheels on the ground.
Scott Lang: Kurt?
Kurt: Eyes in the sky.
Scott Lang: Luis?
Luis: Aw, man, you know it. You know what, I get to wear a uniform, that’s what’s up.
Scott Lang: Luis.
Luis: I’m sorry, I mean, I’m good, I’m good. I’m just excited, and plus you’re girlfriend’s really hot, so you know that makes me nervous too. [to Hope] And you are very beautiful, ma’am.
Dr. Hank Pym: Oh, my lord.
Scott Lang: She’s not my…
Luis: Hey, you know what? I was thinking of a tactic, like when I go undercover, like a whistling, you know I’m saying? To like, blend in.
Scott Lang: No, don’t whistle. No whistling. It’s not the Andy Griffith Show. No whistling.
[on the night of the charity event, Luis makes it in employed as a security guard, outside Dave and Kurt are in their van with Scott in the back dressed in his suit]

Kurt: We’re set.
Scott Lang: Wish me luck. [Scott gets out, shrinks himself as he goes through the water main]
Kurt: Utility is online.
[inside the building Luis starts whistling]

Alpha Guard: Hey. What are you doing?
Luis: Uh, boss-man said to secure the area. So, I’m securing.
Alpha Guard: I’m the boss.
Luis: Oh.
Alpha Guard: [into his radio] Utilities work room three… [Luis suddenly punches him, knocking him out unconscious and then lowers the water level]
Kurt: Water level is dropping.
[Scott floats along on the water with the ants through the pipes]

Kurt: Coming up on extraction pipe.
Scott Lang: I see it! [to the ants] Alright, come on. I gotta get up there. That’s it, that’s it, guys, yeah! [the ants help him climb up to the extraction pipe] That’s it, yeah. Yes! You got it! You got it, come on! [Scott makes it through one of the handwash sinks in the bathroom] Alright, let’s fly Ant-thony. [Scott and the ants fly off]
Kurt: The Ant-Man is in the building.
[as they see Pym pull up outside the building where the charity event is taking place]

Dave: Phshh. Got a Crown Vic right outside over there.
Kurt: This is problem?
Dave: Considering the Crown Vic’s the most commonly used car for under-cover cops, man. Yes, this is a problem. [inside the Crown Vic is Paxton and Gale]
Paxton: That’s Pym. [they get out to go after Pym]
Kurt: Oh, no.
[back with Scott and the ants]

Scott Lang: I’m employing the bullet ants. Hapanera-clamda-mana-merna. I don’t remember what it’s called but I feel bad for this guy. [using the ants Scott takes down one of the security guards with Luis also punching him]
Luis: See, that’s what I’m talkin’ bout. That’s what I call it, an unfortunate casualty, in a very serious operation, you know? [Hope then comes along and enters the room and places the signal decoy]
Kurt: Signal decoy in place. Mean pretty lady did good, Scott.
Dave: Looks like Pym’s getting arrested.
Kurt: Scott, we have problem.
Scott Lang: Problem? What’s the problem? [just then Dave gets out of the can]
Kurt: Dave! Dave, that’s not part of plan!
Dr. Hank Pym: [as Paxton and Gale are trying to arrest Pym] Listen to me, if I don’t get into this building people will die.
Gale: That’s awfully dramatic.
[Dave creates a diversion by stealing Paxton and Gale’s car]

Paxton: Are you kidding me?! [they run after Dave as he drives off in their car]
Kurt: Problem solved.
[inside the building Cross finds Hope]

Darren Cross: Well. How do I look? [they then find Pym as he enters the building] There he is. Just in time. Come on. [Cross takes them to vault where he’s keeping the Yellowjacket suit, and uses an eye scanner to open the door]
Computer: Twelve point verification.
Dr. Hank Pym: Little over the top, don’t you think, Darren?
Computer: Confirming authorization.
Darren Cross: No, you can never be too safe.
Computer: Access granted. [they enter the vault]
Dr. Hank Pym: I gotta hand it to you, Darren, you really did it.
Darren Cross: And you only know the half of it, Hank. [at the same time Carson arrives with his men]
[back to Scott and the ants]

Scott Lang: Arriving at second position. Alright, top speed, Ant-thony! Let’s go. [Scott and Ant-thony fly towards where the Yellowjacket suit is being kept] Proceeding to command position. [Scott jumps off Ant-thony] I’ll be right back, Ant-thony. Alright, guys, I’m in position. I’m going to signal the ants. [Paxton and Gale find their car dumped can crashed into a tree]
Paxton: No, no, no, no! [Dave gets back into the van with Kurt]
Dave: Did you see that? [he honks the musical horn which Paxton recognizes from Scott using it earlier]
[back to Scott instructing the ants]

Scott Lang: Assume formation. Alright you cute little crazies, let’s fry these servers. [the ants fry the servers and Scott jumps back onto Ant-thony] Let’s go get ‘em, buddy!
Kurt: Servers are fried. Data backup completely erased.
Scott Lang: Headed to the particle chamber.
[Carson and his men enters the vault where Cross is with Pym and Hope]

Mitchell Carson: Hello, Dr. Cross. My associates agree to your terms.
Darren Cross: Wonderful. [to Pym] They’re not what they were, they’re doing some interesting work. And I’m enjoying myself. You tried to hide your technology from me, and now it’s gonna blow up in your face. [suddenly Pym punches Cross in the face] Wow. Wow! I mean, I saw the punch coming a mile away but I just figured it’d be all pathetic and weak.
Dr. Hank Pym: Well you figured wrong.
[back outside Paxton and Gale walk over to Luis’s van]

Paxton: I know this van. [he bangs on the van door] Anybody home?
Dave: [to each other inside the van] Shh.
Kurt: Shh.
Dave: Shh!
Kurt: Shh!
Scott Lang: Alright, guys, I’m here. Setting the charges. [Scott set the explosives; to the ants] Great job, guys. I’ll take it from here. [Ant-thony sets Scott down] Good boy, Ant-thony. Final position. [to Kurt and Dave] Guys, how we lookin’ on that laser grid?
Kurt: Almost!
Dave: No, you’re not.
Kurt: I’m getting close!
Dave: No, you’re not. [Paxton keeps banging on Luis’s van door]
Paxton: San Francisco PD! Man in the van! I know you’re in there! [inside the van as they wait for the laser grid to be disabled]
Dave: Make it go faster.
Kurt: Dude, seriously!
Scott Lang: Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?
Kurt: It’s so close.
Paxton: [suddenly the van door opens, Paxton and Gale point their guns at Kurt and Dave] Freeze!
Dave: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute! there was a black guy that looked exactly like me who attacked us and put us in the back of this disgusting van.
Paxton: Get out.
Dave: Take it easy!
Kurt: [Paxton pulls Kurt out of the van at the same time the laser grid is disabled; to Scott] Go! Go now! [Scott jumps to get to the Yellowjacket] Wait!
Scott Lang: What? What do you mean wait? [Kurt manages to struggle free from Paxton’s hold to press a button on his computer to fully disable the lasers and just as Scott goes to grab the suit it’s pulled away] What? What? [Cross sees Scott and taps on the glass]
Darren Cross: Hi, little guy. [to Pym] I always suspected you had a suit stored away somewhere, which begs the question, who is the new Ant-Man? Who is the man that my beloved mentor trusted even more than me? [pauses a moment] Scott Lang. The martyr, who took on the system and paid the price, losing his family and his only daughter in the process. Exactly your kind of guy, Hank. He escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how, and then, he disappears magically, despite having no money to his name, and now he brings me the Ant-Man suit, the only thing that can rival my creation.
Dr. Hank Pym: Darren, don’t do this. If you sell to these men, it’s going to be chaos.
Darren Cross: I already have, and for twice the price, thanks to you. It’s not easy to successfully infiltrate an Avengers facility. Thankfully, word travels fast. Oh, I’ll sell them the Yellowjacket, but I’m keeping the particle to myself. They don’t run on diesel. If you want the fuel you’ll have to come to me. What do you call the only man who can arm the most powerful weapon in the world?
Dr. Hank Pym: The most powerful man in the world.
Darren Cross: You proud of me yet?
Dr. Hank Pym: You can stop this, Darren. It’s not too late.
Darren Cross: It’s been too late for a long time now. [one of the men in the chamber points their gun at Pym]
Hope van Dyne: Darren, what are you doing?
Darren Cross: He wasn’t any more capable of caring for you than he was for me.
Hope van Dyne: This is not who you are, it’s the particles altering your brain chemistry.
Darren Cross: [to the guy pointing a gun at Pym] Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You’re right, I have to be the one to do it. [he points a gun at Pym’s head, at the same time Hope takes out her weapon and points it at Cross]
Mitchell Carson: Here we go.
Hope van Dyne: Drop your gun.
Darren Cross: You know I came to the house the other night to kill him, but you were there.
Hope van Dyne: You’re sick and I can help you just put the gun down.
Darren Cross: I wasn’t ready to kill you then, but I think I am now!
Hope van Dyne: Drop your gun, now!
Darren Cross: You picked the wrong side, Hope. [just then Scott breaks out using the disc Pym gave him that turn things large, he starts fighting off the men in the chamber and Pym is shot in the chaos]
Hope van Dyne: Dad! [grabbing hold of the wounded Pym]
Scott Lang: Hank. No, no. Hank. Hank. Listen, you’re gonna be okay. Alright? You’re gonna be just fine. [Cross comes up behind Scott and points his gun at the back of Scott’s head]
Darren Cross: Take the suit off or I’ll blow your brains out and peel it off! [Scott instructs the ants to disable Cross’ gun and bite him, so he takes off and the same time Carson takes off with vial of Cross’ particles]
Paxton: [Luis sets off the alarm to the building; into his radio] We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech, request immediate backup.
Dave: [Paxton and Gale head off; to Kurt] Go, go, go! [Dave and Kurt get into the van and drive off]
Hope van Dyne: [inside the vault] Dad, can you move?
Dr. Hank Pym: Yes.
Scott Lang: We need to get him out of here.
Hope van Dyne: Go get that suit. [Scott takes off and tries to get away from the two guards shooting at him]
[Scott shrinks himself into the small building model of Cross of Tech to get away from the guards shooting at him, then Luis comes to the rescue and knocks out the guards]

Luis: Hey, Scotty. Hey, did I save your life? Scotty? Scotty? [Scott makes himself large again]
Scott Lang: Thank you, Luis.
Luis: Hey, are we the good guys?
Scott Lang: Yeah.
Luis: We’re the good guys, right?
Scott Lang: Yeah, we’re the good guys.
Luis: Feels kind of weird, you know?
Scott Lang: Yeah, but we’re not done yet. Get out of here before this place blows. [Scott shrinks himself and takes off]
Luis: [as Luis tries to leave the building he remembers the guard he knocked out earlier] Oh, dammit! That guy. [he opens the door and rushes to the guard who is tied up] Hey! We’re getting out of here! [back inside the vault Hope helps Pym sit up]
Hope van Dyne: The charges are set. We’ve got to find a way out of here and fast.
Dr. Hank Pym: Don’t worry. I’m not gonna die, and neither are you. [he holds up a keychain that looks like a tank] It’s not a keychain.
[outside]

Paxton: [into his radio] All the chaos in here! Multiple shots fired. [suddenly a tank bursts out through the building] And there’s a tank. [Luis then walks out of the building with the guard]
Luis: A little help. [someone takes hold of the guard, at the same time Hope helps Pym out of the tank] I got him. [Luis helps Pym]
Hope van Dyne: We need a doctor! [a medic comes over to help Pym]
[Cross is in his helicopter]

Darren Cross: Let’s go! [just as they are about to leave Cross sees a swarm of flung ants heading towards him with Scott on Ant-thony, Cross takes out a gun and starts shooting and one of the bullets hits Ant-thony]
Scott Lang: Ant-thony! [Scott falls onto another ant]
Darren Cross: Go! [the helicopter door is closed]
Scott Lang: You’re gonna regret that. [Cross’ helicopter takes off] [Paxton sees Luis as he gets into his van]
Paxton: Wait a minute! Get out of that van!
Luis: What?
Paxton: Get out of that van!
Luis: It’s too loud there’s a tank, I can’t hear you! [he closes the van door and Dave drives off]
Paxton: Hey! Hey! [Scott makes it into Cross’ helicopter and Cross starts shooting at him]
Darren Cross: Did you think you could stop the future with a heist?
Scott Lang: It was never just a heist! [Scott sets off charges set around Pym Technologies and Cross watches in shock as the whole building is destroyed] Put the gun down!
[Cross hits Scott and he falls out of the helicopter window back into his normal size] [Scott manages to get back into the helicopter but finds Cross wearing the Yellowjacket, they both shrink start fighting and fall into a briefcase which falls out of the helicopter]

Darren Cross: I’m gonna disintegrate you! [inside the briefcase they accidentally hit the cell phone]
Cell Phone: Playing “Disintegration” by The Cure. [“Disintegration” by The Cure starts playing as Scott and Cross continue to fight]]
[[Briefcase falls into a family’s pool, Scott and Cross blast out in a splash as they return to normal size]

Pool BBQ Dad: Call 911! [Scott and Cross continue to fight shrinking and growing until Scott swats Cross into a bug zapper]
Scott Lang: It’s okay. [the family runs off in fear]
[Paxton and Gale show up]

Gale: Police! Put your hands up!
Paxton: Get ‘em up! [Scott pulls up his helmet] Scott?
Scott Lang: Paxton, you have to listen to me- [as Scott goes to walk towards Paxton they taser him and falls down unconscious]
[as Paxton and Gale are driving Scott back to the police station Scott wakes up] Paxton, turn around, take me back.

Paxton: I’m taking you back, to prison.
Scott Lang: There’s something in that backyard that needs to be destroyed. In the bug zapper, it…
Paxton: [Paxton suddenly stops the car and turns to Scott] You need to desist right now! Your delusions are out of hand!
Police Radio: All units we have a 236 in progress at 840 Winter Street.
Scott Lang: It’s Cassie! [Paxton takes off towards his house]
[Cross is standing in Cassie’s room looking menacing]

Darren Cross: Don’t be scared. [Paxton pulls up outside his house]
Paxton: Maggie, what’s going on?
Maggie Lang: He’s got Cassie!
Paxton: Who’s got Cassie?
Maggie Lang: That thing, that thing! I don’t know what it… ! [back in Paxton’s car, Scott manages to put on his helmet, shrinks and takes off]
[Cross starts walking towards Cassie]

Cassie Lang: Are you a monster?
Darren Cross: Do I look like a monster?
Cassie Lang: I want my daddy!
Darren Cross: I want your daddy too. [he picks up Cassie and she screams, just then Scott shows up] There you are.
Cassie Lang: Daddy, is that you? [Scott pulls up his helmet]
Scott Lang: Hi, Peanut. [to Cross] Why don’t you pick on someone your own size? [he throws a disc at Cross which shrinks him then he shrinks himself, Cross is now on the Thomas The Tank Engine toy in Cassie’s room]
Darren Cross: Now where did you go, little guy? [he spots Scott running towards him] There you are. [he starts firing lasers from his suit at Scott]
Scott Lang: Not just me. [a swarm of ants follow behind Scott] Get him! Go! Go! [Cross fights off the ants as they attack him, then Scott and Cross fight across the Thomas The Tank Engine toy]
Luis: [as they drive towards Paxton’s house] Scotty needs us, you know what I’m sayin’? Ain’t nothin’ gonna stop us. [they stop as they see a load of police cars and cops surrounding the house] Back it up. Back it up slow.
Dave: Yeah. [Dave starts to slowly back the van away]
Luis: Just back it up.
Dave: Yep, yep.
Luis: Back it up.
Dave: Okay.
Luis: All we gonna do is, we ju… we just back it up.
Dave: Okay. That’s it.
Luis: Back it up.
Dave: That’s right.
Luis: Back it up.
Dave: Yep.
Luis: Okay, now-now-now. Just back it up.
Darren Cross: [as they continue to fight in Cassie’s room inside the Thomas The Tank Engine railway] You insult me, Scott. Your very existence is insulting to me. [Cross shoots his laser at Scott as he runs around Cassie’s room] You know it would be much easier to hit you if you were bigger!
Scott Lang: Yeah, I agree. [Scott throws two discs at Cross, he deflects it one hitting an ant the other the Thomas The Tank Engine toy and they both grow large]
Paxton: Cassie! [Paxton runs into the house]
Darren Cross: I’m gonna show you just how insignificant you are. [Paxton goes to run up the stairs]
Paxton: Cassie, I’m coming! [suddenly the large ant heads his way, he falls down the stairs as the giant ant breaks out of the house]
Gale: That’s a messed-up looking dog.
Darren Cross: [back inside Cassie’s room; to Scott] I’m going to destroy everything you love! [Paxton shows up]
Paxton: Freeze! S.F.P.D.! [Cross throws Paxton’s gun aside, at the same time Scott climbs up the back of Cross’ suit]
Scott Lang: I can’t break through!
Darren Cross: It’s titanium, you idiot!
Scott Lang: [to Paxton as Scott and Paxton continue fighting] Get her out of here! [Paxton carries Cassie off]
Paxton: Come on.
Darren Cross: [as Paxton goes to leave the room with Cassie in his arms Cross stops them] Sorry, sweetheart. You have to help daddy pay for his mistakes.
Paxton: You stay behind me, okay?
Cassie Lang: Okay.
Paxton: Behind me. [Scott looks up at Cross’ particle pack]
Scott Lang: I’m gonna have to shrink between the molecules to get in there. [to Cross] Get away from us! Daddy, help! [Scott jumps up to head towards Cross’ particle pack] I love you, Cassie. [Scott shrinks to a small enough size to break into Cross’ particle pack, this causes Cross and Scott to go subatomic and disappear]
Cassie Lang: Daddy, where are you? [Scott floats past dust, viruses, molecules, atoms, hadrons, quarks, and finally the deepest parts of gluons and remembers Pym’s words]
Dr. Hank Pym: [voice] Go sub-atomic… go sub-atomic… [Scott tries to grow himself back to normal size but realized he can’t]
Scott Lang: Oh, no. [he continues to float in the quantum realm]
Dr. Hank Pym: [voice] You would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space become irrelevant. And as you shrink for all eternity, everything that you know and love gone forever. [Scott hears Cassie’s voice echoing as he floats in the quantum realm]
Cassie Lang: [voice] Daddy! Where are you? Daddy!
Scott Lang: Cassie.
Cassie Lang: [voice] Come on, daddy. [Scott remembers the discs Pym had given him and takes one out]
Dr. Hank Pym: [voice] Do not mess with the regulator. [Scott places the disc in the regulator, presses the button and finally returns to normal size] I love you so much.
Scott Lang: I love you too, so much.
Paxton: [as Scott is holding onto Cassie Paxton mildly gets Scott’s attention] There’s a big hole in the roof.
Scott Lang: Sorry. [Gale runs up to Cassie’s room and we see Paxton holding Cassie and Scott has gone]
Gale: Is she alright?
Paxton: She’s fine. [Maggie enters the room]
Cassie Lang: Mommy. [Maggie grabs hold of Cassie with relief]
Paxton: She’s fine, she’s fine. [Cassie notices Scott in his shrunken size wave goodbye to her and leaves]
[the next day Scott is over at Pym’s house]

Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, please. You don’t remember anything?
Scott Lang: Hank, I… I don’t.
Dr. Hank Pym: There must be something else. Well I suppose the human mind just can’t comprehend the experience, but you made it. You went in and you got out, that’s amazing.
Hope van Dyne: Scott, I’ll walk you out.
Scott Lang: [to Pym] Get some rest. [Scott and Hope leave the room, Pym looks over to the photo of himself with his wife holding Hope when she was a baby]
Dr. Hank Pym: Is it possible? [Pym gets up to leave his room, as he opens the door he finds Hope and Scott kissing] When did this happen?
Hope van Dyne: Nothing’s happening.
Scott Lang: Whoa, hold on. Something’s kind of happening.
Dr. Hank Pym: Well if that’s the case… shoot me again.
Scott Lang: [looking at Hope] Yeah, I don’t know what you’re doing grabbing me and kissing me like that. I was a little surprised myself. I have to get somewhere. I’ll see you later, Hank. Really, Hope. [Scott turns to leave]
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott.
Scott Lang: Yeah?
Dr. Hank Pym: You’re full of shit.
Scott Lang: Oh, yeah.
[Scott is having dinner with Paxton, Maggie, and Cassie]

Paxton: Well, Scott I met with my Captain today, he wanted a report of the night that you got out of jail. Something happened with the cameras, circuits got fried, and… But I told him you were processed correctly.
Scott Lang: Really?
Paxton: Well, yeah. Can’t be sending Cassie’s dad back to jail on a technical glitch, right?
Scott Lang: Thank you, Paxton. I’m blown away. Thank you for everything you do for Cassie.
Paxton: Oh, well, that’s my pleasure. But no, no, this one, I… I did it for you.
Scott Lang: This is awkward.
Paxton: Yeah.
Cassie Lang: Yeah.
Scott Lang: I mean what do we even talk about after all of that?
Cassie Lang: Oh, I know.
Scott Lang: What?
Cassie Lang: I did my first cartwheel today.
Scott Lang: What?
Maggie Lang: Yeah. She has been practicing all week, but today was the magic day.
Paxton: I recorded it on my phone here. [Paxton shows Scott his recording of Cassie doing her first cartwheel]
Scott Lang: No, that can’t be Cassie. That’s not you.
Maggie Lang: Yeah, it is.
Cassie Lang: Yeah it is.
Scott Lang: This is a professional gymnast, there’s no way that’s you.
Paxton: Yeah, that’s her. [Cassie feeds the giant ant hiding under the table that had escaped during Scott and Cross’ fight]
Cassie Lang: Good, boy. [after watching the video of Cassie doing her cartwheel]
Scott Lang: Sweetie, that’s pretty amazing, Peanut. [just then Scott gets a call] Sorry. It’s work. [he answers the call] Yeah?
[Scott meets up with Luis, Dave and Kurt]

Scott Lang: Alright, here’s the deal. Just give me the facts.
Luis: Just the facts, only the facts.
Scott Lang: Breathe, focus, keep it simple.
Luis: No, no, no, no doubt, no doubt. Okay, so I’m at this art museum with my cousin Ignacio, right? And there was this, like, abstract expressionism exhibit, but you know me, I’m more like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right? But there was this one Rothko that was sublime, bro. Oh, my God…
Scott Lang: Luis.
Luis: Okay. Sorry, sorry. I’m ju… you know, uh, I just get excited and stuff. But anyway, anyway. When Ignacio tells me: “Yoh, I met this crazy fine writer chick at this spot last night. Like, fine, fine, crazy stupid fine.” And he goes up to the bartender and goes: “Look at the girl I’m with? You know what I’m sayin’? She’s crazy stupid fine, right?” [we see flashback to Ignacio meeting the girl and talking to the bartender who is in fact Stan Lee] And the bartender’s all like: “Yeah, crazy stupid fine.” So this writer chick tells Ignacio: “Yoh, I’m like a boss in the world of guerrilla journalism, and I got mad connects with the peeps behind the curtains. You know what I’m sayin’?” Ignacio’s like: “For real? And she’s like: Yeah. You know what, I can’t tell you who my contact is, because he works with the Avengers.”
Scott Lang: Oh, no.
Luis: Yeah, and this dude sounds like a bad-ass, man. Like he comes up to her and says… [we see flashback of the girl meting up with Sam Wilson in a park] “Yoh, I’m looking for this dude who’s no one seen, who’s flashing this fresh tack, who’s got, like, bomb moves, right? Who you got? She’s like: “Well, we got everything nowadays, we got a guy who jumps, we got a guy who swings, we got a guy who crawls up the walls. You gotta be more specific.” And he’s like: “I’m looking for a guy who shrinks.” And I’m like: “Damn!” [to Scott] I got all nervous cause I keep mad secrets for you, bro. So I asked Ignacio: “Did bad-ass tell the stupid fine writer chick to tell you to tell me because I’m tight with that man, that he’s looking for him?”
Scott Lang: And? What’d he say?
Luis: He said yes.
[mid-credit scene; Hank brings Hope down to his lab]

Dr. Hank Pym: There’s something I want to show you. I realized you can’t destroy power, all you can do is to make sure that it’s in the right hands. [he opens up a vault to reveal the prototype of the Wasp suit] This is an advanced prototype that your mother and I worked on together. She never got to use it, but now I realize that we were… we were working on it for you. [Hope looks at the suit in shock then back to Pym] Maybe it’s time we finished it. [Hope looks back at the suit and smiles]
Hope van Dyne: It’s about damn time.
[post-credits scene: Sam and Steve Rogers are in a garage with the Winter Soldier, his metal arm tightly clamped in a vise and a forlorn look on his face]

Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap! [Steve and Sam are in an underground room with they are holding Bucky Barnes with his metal arm trapped in a vice] This would have been a lot easier a week ago.
Steve Rogers: If we call Tony…
Sam Wilson: He won’t believe us.
Steve Rogers: Even if he did…
Sam Wilson: Who knows if the accords will let him help?
Steve Rogers: We’re on our own.
Sam Wilson: Maybe not. I know a guy.
[the final screen text shows “ANT-MAN WILL RETURN”]

[first lines; in the Arctic]
Search Team Leader: Are you the guys from Washington?
SHIELD Tech: You get many other visitors out here?
SHIELD Lieutenant: How long have you been on site?
Search Team Leader: Since this morning. A Russian oil team called it in about 18 hours ago.
SHIELD Lieutenant: How come nobody spotted it before?
Search Team Leader: It’s really not that surprising. This landscape’s changing all the time. You got any ideas what this thing is exactly?
SHIELD Lieutenant: I don’t know. It’s probably a weather balloon.
Search Team Leader: I don’t think so. You know we don’t have the equipment for a job like this.
SHIELD Tech: How long before we can start craning it out?
Search Team Leader: I don’t think you quite understand. You guys are gonna need one hell of a crane!
[as the shot widens we see a massive frozen ship revealed]
[after breaking into the metal aircraft]
SHIELD Lieutenant: [speaking into his comm] Base, we’re in. [looking around] What is this? [The technician nearly slipps on the ice covering the ground] Careful.
SHIELD Tech: [finding the frozen shield of Captain America] Lieutenant! What is it?
SHIELD Lieutenant: My God! [into his earpiece] Base, give me a line to the Colonel.
Voice from Earpiece: It’s 3 a.m., sir.
SHIELD Lieutenant: I don’t care what time it is. This one’s waited long enough.
[March 1942 Tønsberg, Norway]
[a villager, Jan, is running to a church]
Jan: [subtitled] They have come for it!
Tower Keeper: [subtitled] They have before.
Jan: [subtitled] Not like this.
Tower Keeper: [subtitled] Let them come. They will never find it.
[rumbling is heard and something breaks down the door, the stones killing Jan]
[the tower keeper closes Jan’s eyes and sees a machine moving away as HYDRA agents come in]
[a car drives up with the HYDRA symbol on the hood]
[HYDRA agents try to lift the lid of a coffin]
Hydra Lieutenant: Open it! Quickly, before he…
Johann Schmidt: It has taken me a long time to find this place. [to the Tower Keeper] You should be commended. [to one of his soldiers] Help him up.
[one of the soldiers helps the tower keeper to his feet]
Johann Schmidt: I think that you are man of great vision. And in this way we are much alike.
Tower Keeper: I am nothing like you.
Johann Schmidt: No, of course. But what others see as superstition, you and I know to be a science.
Tower Keeper: What you seek is just a legend.
Johann Schmidt: Then why make such an effort to conceal it? [opens an old tomb and picks up the glass cube from the skeletal remains of an old Viking] The Tesseract was the jewel of Odin’s treasure room. [he turns to face the tower keeper and deliberately drops and smashes the glass cube] It’s not something one buries. But I think it is close, yes?
Tower Keeper: I cannot help you.
Johann Schmidt: No. But maybe you can help your village. You must have some friends out there. Some… some little grandchildren perhaps. I have no need for them to die. [A big tank outside turns his guns towards the village threateningly.]
[referring to the carving of the tree on one of the tower walls]
Johann Schmidt: Yggdrasil. Tree of the world. Guardian of wisdom and fate, also. [he presses a button on the carving of the tree and it opens up to reveal the real cube] And the Führer digs for trinkets in the desert. You have never seen this, have you?
Tower Keeper: It’s not for the eyes of ordinary men.
Johann Schmidt: Exactly. [he closes the box containing the glowing cube and turns to his soldiers] Gove the order to open fire.
Hydra Lieutenant: Jawohl! (Yes!)
Tower Keeper: Fool! You cannot control the power you hold. You will burn!
Johann Schmidt: I already have. [He shoots and kills the tower keeper]
[In New York, at the enrollment facility.]
4F Doctor: [off-screen] O’Connel, Michael. Kaminsky, Henry.
Steve Rogers: Boy, a lot of guys getting killed over there.
4F Doctor: [off-screen] Rogers, Steven.
[Steve puts down the newspaper he is reading]
Enlistment Guy: It kind of makes you think twice about enlisting, huh?
Steve Rogers: Nope.
[as Steve is standing half naked in front of the doctor to examine him for enlistment]
4F Doctor: Rogers. What did your father die of?
Steve Rogers: Mustard gas. He was in the hundred and seventh infantry. I was hoping I could be assigned…
4F Doctor: Your mother?
Steve Rogers: She was a nurse in a TB ward. Got hit, couldn’t shake it. [the doctor looks at Steve’s file which shows he has a long list of health issues]
4F Doctor: Sorry, son.
Steve Rogers: Look, just give me a chance.
4F Doctor: You’d be ineligible on your asthma alone.
Steve Rogers: Is there anything you can do?
4F Doctor: I’m doing it. I’m saving your life. [He stamps the card 4F.]
[later, Steve is at the movie theater]
[a commercial about the war is playing before the movie]
Commercial Announcer: War continues to ravage Europe. But help is on the way. Every able-bodied young man is lining up to serve his country. Even little Timmy is doing his part collecting scrap metal. Nice work, Timmy!
Loud Jerk: Who cares? Play the movie already!
Steve Rogers: [quietly] Hey, you wanna show some respect?
Commercial Announcer: Meanwhile, overseas, our brave boys are showing the Axis powers that the price freedom is never too high.
Loud Jerk: Let’s got! Get on with it! Hey, just start the cartoon!
Steve Roger: Hey buddy, you wanna shut up?!
[the guy gets up and looks at him]
Commercial Announcer: Together with Allied forces, we’ll face any threat, no matter the size.
[getting beaten in an alley by the loud jerk that was disturbing everyone at the cinema]
Loud Jerk: You just don’t know when to give up, do you?
Steve Rogers: I can do this all day. [and attacks the guy again]
James Barnes: Hey! Pick on someone your own size.
[after saving Steve from getting any further beatings by the loud jerk]
James Barnes: Sometimes, I think you like getting punched.
Steve Rogers: I had him on the ropes.
[picks up Steve’s enlistment form from the ground]
James Barnes: How many times is this?
[reading from the enlistment form]
James Barnes: Oh, you’re from Paramus now? You know it’s illegal to lie on the enlistment form. And seriously, Jersey?
Steve Rogers: You get your orders?
James Barnes: The one-o-seventh. Sergeant James Barnes. Shipping out for England first thing tomorrow.
Steve Rogers: I should be going.
James Barnes: Come on, man. My last night! Gotta get you cleaned up.
Steve Rogers: Why? Where are we going?
James Barnes: The future.
[he hands him the newspaper he was holding, Steve opens it to see the ad for World Exposition Of Tomorrow, 1943]
James Barnes: I don’t see what the problem is. You’re about to be the last eligible man in New York. You know, there’s three and a half million women here.
Steve Rogers: Well, I’d settle for just one.
James Barnes: Good thing I took care of that.
[He waves to the dates, Connie and Bonnie, he’s lined up]
Connie: Hey, Bucky!
Steve Rogers: What did you tell her about me?
James Barnes: Only the good stuff.
[music starts playing]
Expo Announcer: Welcome to the Modern Marvels Paviliion and the World of Tomorrow. A greater world. A better world.
Connie: Oh, my God! It’s starting!
Mandy: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Howard Stark!
[Howard enters the stage and kisses the announcer]
Random Woman: I love you, Howard!
Howard Stark: [addressing the audience at the World Exposition fair] Ladies and gentlemen, what if I told you that in just a few short years, your automobile won’t even have to touch the ground at all.
[the female helpers take the wheels of the car on stage]
Howard Stark: Yes. Thanks, Mandy. [addressing the audience again] With Stark robotic reversion technology, you’ll be able to do just that.
[he turns on the switch of his machine and the car starts to hover off the ground]
James Barnes: Holy cow.
[the robots making the car hover suddenly malfunction and the car falls back on stage]
Howard Stark: I did say a few years, didn’t I?
[everyone laughs]
[Steve disappears, and Bucky notices]
James Barnes: Hey, Steve, what do you say we treat these girls…
[at a recruitment center]
Woman: [to her male company, pulling him away from a mirror making him look like a soldier] Come on, soldier.
[Steve steps in front of the mirror but he’s too short to fill out the face]
James Barnes: Come on. You’re kind of missing the point of a double date. We’re taking the girls dancing.
Steve Rogers: You go ahead. I’ll catch up with you.
James Barnes: You’re really gonna do this again?
Steve Rogers: Well, it’s a fair. I’m gonna try my luck.
James Barnes: As who? Steve from Ohio? They’ll catch you. Or worse, they’ll actually take you.
Steve Rogers: Look, I know you don’t think I can do this.
James Barnes: This isn’t a back alley, Steve. It’s war!
Steve Rogers: I know it’s a war. You don’t have to tell me.
James Barnes: Why are you so keen to fight? There are so many important jobs.
Steve Rogers: What am I gonna do? Collect scrap metal…
James Barnes: Yes!
Steve Rogers: …in my little red wagon.
James Barnes: Why not?
Steve Rogers: I’m not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.
James Barnes: I don’t…
Steve Rogers: Bucky, come on! There are men laying down their lives. I got no right to do any less than them. That’s what you don’t understand. This isn’t about me.
James Barnes: Right. Cause you got nothing to prove.
Connie: Hey, Sarge! Are we going dancing?
James Barnes: [he turns to the girls] Yes, we are. [back to Steve] Don’t do anything stupid until I get back.
Steve Rogers: How can I? You’re taking all the stupid with you.
James Barnes: You’re a punk.
[he walks back towards Steve and hugs him goodbye]
Steve Rogers: Jerk. Be careful.
[as James is walking away]
Steve Rogers: Don’t win the war till I get there!
James Barnes: [He salutes then starts to walk away] Come on girls. They’re playing our song.
[Steve is in a medical examination room when a nurse whispers something inaudible to Young Doctor]
Young Doctor: Wait here.
Steve Rogers: Is there a problem?
Young Doctor: Just wait here. [walks out]
[Steve looks at a sign warning against lying on your enlistment form and starts to get ready to leave]
[An Enlistment Office MP walks in the room and Steve looks up at him worriedly]
[Dr. Abraham Erskine enters the room as Enlistment Office MP quietly leaves]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [to the MP] Thank you. [to Steve] So, you want to go overseas. Kill some Nazis.
Steve Rogers: Excuse me?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Dr. Abraham Erskine. [walks over and introduces himself to Steve] I represent the Strategic Scientific Reserve.
Steve Rogers: Steve Rogers.
[Dr. Erskine starts looking through Steve’s file]
Steve Rogers: Where are you from?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Queens. 73rd Street and Utopia Parkway. Before that, Germany. This troubles you?
Steve Rogers: [shakes his head] No.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [flipping through Steve’s file] Where are you from, Mr. Rogers? Mmm? Is it New Haven? Or Paramus? Five exams in five different cities.
Steve Rogers: That might not be the right file.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: No, it’s not the exams I’m interested in. It’s the five tries. But you didn’t answer my question. Do you want to kill Nazis?
Steve Rogers: Is this a test?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yes.
Steve Rogers: I don’t wanna kill anyone. I don’t like bullies. I don’t care where they’re from.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Well, there are already so many big men fighting this war. Maybe what we need now is the little guy, huh? I can offer you a chance.
[They exit the room]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Only a chance.
Steve Rogers: I’ll take it.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Good. So where is the little guy from, actually?
Steve Rogers: Brooklyn.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [Dr. Erskine stamps Steve’s form and hands him back his file] Congratulations, soldier.
[Steve opens up the file and sees that he’s been stamped as accepted]
[In a HYDRA lab in a very mountainous region]
Johann Schmidt: Are you ready, Dr. Zola?
Dr. Arnim Zola: My machine requires the most delicate calibration. Forgive me if I seem overcautious.
Johann Schmidt: And are you certain that those conductors of yours can withstand the energy surge long enough for a transference?
Dr. Arnim Zola: With this artifact, I am certain of nothing. I fear it may not work at all.
[Schmidt inserts the Tesseract carefully into the machine. Zola starts it up.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: Twenty percent. Forty. Sixty. Stabilising at 70%.
Johann Schmidt: [takes over the controls] I have not come all this way for safety, Doctor. [He turns the controls up to maximum and blue light flitters through the room.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: What is that?
[after successfully collecting the power from the glowing Tesseract using Zola’s machine]
Johann Schmidt: I must congratulate you, Arnim. Your designs do not disappoint. Though they may require some slight reinforcement.
Dr. Arnim Zola: The exchange is stable. Amazing! The energy we have just collected could power my design, all my designs. This will change the war.
Johann Schmidt: Dr. Zola, this will change the world.
[At a US training camp. Steve stands in line with others.]
Officer: [off-screen to other soldiers training] Ready, exercise!
Peggy Carter: Recruits, attention! Gentlemen, I’m Agent Carter. I supervise all operations for this division.
Gilmore Hodge: What’s with the accent, Queen Victoria? Thought I was signing up for the U.S. Army.
Peggy Carter: What’s your name, soldier?
Gilmore Hodge: Gilmore Hodge, your Majesty.
Peggy Carter: Step forward, Hodge.
[Hodge steps forward, smirking]
Peggy Carter: Put your right foot forward.
Gilmore Hodge: Mmm… We gonna wrassle? Cause I got a few moves I know you’ll like.
[suddenly Peggy punches him hard in the face]
[Col.Phillips drives up]
Col. Chester Phillips: Agent Carter.
Peggy Carter: Colonel Phillips.
Col. Chester Phillips: I see you’re breaking in the candidates. That’s good! [to Hodge] Get your ass up out of that dirt and stand in that line at attention 'til somebody comes tells you what to do.
Gilmore Hodge: [he gets back up] Yes, sir.
Col. Chester Phillips: [addressing the new army recruits] General Patton has said that wars are fought with weapons but they are won by men. We are going to win this war because we have the best men… [he sees Rogers and continues talking] And because they’re gonna get better. Much better. The Strategic Scientific Reserve is an Allied effort made up of the best minds in the free world. Our goal is to create the best army in history. But every army starts with one man. At the end of this week we will choose that man. He will be the first in a new breed of super-soldiers. [While Phillips talk we see scenes of Steve unpacking and training where he fails to keep up and gets bullied by the others.]
Sergeant Duffy: Rogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!
Col. Chester Phillips: And they, will personally escort Adolf Hitler to the gates of Hell.
[then we see Steve and some other trainees running up to a waiting Peggy and a flagpole]
Sergeant Duffy: Pick up the pace, ladies! Let’s go! Double time! Come on! Faster! Faster! Move! Move! [they arrive at the flag pole] Squad, halt! That flag means we’re only at the halfway point. First man to bring it to me gets a ride back with Agent Carter. Move, move!
Soldiers: Come on! Get up there!
Sergeant Duffy: [the soldier try to climb up the pole to no avail] If that’s all you got, this army’s in trouble! Get up there, Hodge! Come on! Get up there! Nobody’s got that flag in 17 years! Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in! Let’s go! Get back into formation! Rogers! I said fall in! [Steve pulls a pin out at the bottom of the pole causing it to fall over.]
Steve Rogers: [as he gives the flag to Sergeant Duffy] Thank you, sir. [He climbs into the car and they drive away.]
[The soldiers are doing push-ups.]
Peggy Carter: Faster, ladies! Come on. My grandmother has more life in her, God rest her soul. Move it!
Col. Chester Phillips: [walking besides Erskine] You’re not really thinking about picking Rogers, are you?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: I am more than just thinking about it. He is the clear choice.
Col. Chester Phillips: When you brought a ninety-pound asthmatic onto my army base, I let it slide. I thought, what the hell? Maybe he’ll be useful to you, like a gerbil. I never thought you’d pick him. [referring to Steve]
Peggy Carter: [as Phillips and Erskine arrive she commands the soldiers:] Up.
Col. Chester Phillips: You stick a needle in that kids arm and it’s gonna go right through him. [watching Steve struggling whilst training with the other new recruits]
Peggy Carter: Come on, girls.
Col. Chester Phillips: Look at that. He’s making me cry.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: I am looking for qualities beyond the physical.
Col. Chester Phillips: Do you know how long it took to set up this project?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah, I know.
Col. Chester Phillips: All the groveling I had to do in front of Senator What’s-His-Name’s committees?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Brandt. Yes, I know. I am well aware of your efforts.
Col. Chester Phillips: Then throw me a bone. Hodge passed every test we gave him. He’s big, he’s fast, he obeys orders. He’s a soldier.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: He’s a bully.
Col. Chester Phillips: You don’t win wars with niceness, doctor. [he takes a hand grenade] You win war with guts. [he throws the grenade at where the new recruits are training] Grenade!
[all the soldiers move away quickly but Steve jumps on top of it covering it with his body]
Steve Rogers: Get away! Get back! [waits for the grenade to go off but nothing happens]
Officer: It was a dummy grenade. All clear. Back in formation.
[Steve looks at Phillips and Erskine]
Steve Rogers: Is this is a test?
[Erskine looks at Phillips as to confirm his point about choosing Steve]
Col. Chester Phillips: He’s still skinny.
[later that night, Steve sits on his bunk reading. Erskine knocks on the door.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: May I?
Steve Rogers: Yeah.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Can’t sleep?
Steve Rogers: I got the jitters, I guess.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [laughs] Me, too.
Steve Rogers: Can I ask you a question?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Just one? [he sits down facing Steve]
Steve Rogers: Why me?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: I suppose that is the only question that matters. [He looks down at the bottle of schnapps he brought with him.] This is from Augsburg. My city. So many people forget that the first country that the Nazi’s invaded was their own. You know, after the last war the… my people struggled. They… they felt weak. They felt small. And then Hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and the… and the… [he waves his hand] And he… he hears of me, my work and he finds me. And he says, "You." He says, "You will make us strong." Well, I am not interested. So he sends the head of HYDRA, his research division. A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt. Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he’s ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power hidden in the earth, left here by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist.
[flashback of how Schmidt takes Erskine’s formula and injects himself with it]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Schmidt must become that superior man.
Steve Rogers: Did it make him stronger?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah. But, there were other effects. The serum was not ready. But more important, the man. The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.
Steve Rogers: Thanks. I think.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [he pours 2 drinks] Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing. That you will stay who you are. Not a perfect soldier, but a good man.
[Steve holds up his glass to toast]
Steve Rogers: To the little guys.
[just as Steve’s about to drink from his glass]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: No! No! Wait! Wait! What I am doing? No! You have a procedure tomorrow. No fluids.
[he pours the contents of Steve’s glass into his own]
Steve Rogers: All right. We’ll drink it after.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: No! I don’t have procedure tomorrow. Drink it after? Drink it now!
[At the Hydra facility, in Schmidt’s lab.]
Johann Schmidt: [he turns off the light] Is there something in particular you need? [An artist is painting Schmidt’s portrait in oil.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: I understand you found him.
Johann Schmidt: See for yourself. [Zola steps over to the table to find several survaillance photos of Dr. Erskine.] You disapprove.
Dr. Arnim Zola: I just don’t see why you need concern yourself. I can’t imagine he will succeed. [looking nervously at Schmidt] Again.
Johann Schmidt: His serum is the Allies’ only defence against this power we now possess. If we take it away from them, then our victory is assured.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Shall I give the order?
Johann Schmidt: It has been given.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Good. [he turns to go]
Johann Schmidt: Dr. Zola. [he turns on the lights] What do you think?
Dr. Arnim Zola: A masterpiece. [the artist looks relieved with Zola’s assessment]
[Steve and Peggy whilst driving through Brooklyn]
Steve Rogers: I know this neighborhood. I got beat up in that alley. And that parking lot. And behind that diner.
Peggy Carter: Did you have something against running away?
Steve Rogers: You start running they’ll never let you stop. You stand up, push back. Can’t say no forever, right?
Peggy Carter: I know a little of what that’s like. To have every door shut in your face.
Steve Rogers: I guess I just don’t why you’d wanna join the army if you’re a beautiful dame. Or a beautiful… a woman. An agent, not a dame! You are beautiful, but…
Peggy Carter: You have no idea how to talk to a woman, do you?
Steve Rogers: This is the longers conversation I’ve had with one. Women aren’t exactly lining up to dance with a guy they might step on.
Peggy Carter: You must have danced?
Steve Rogers: Well, asking a woman to dance always seems so terrifying. And the past few years just didn’t seem to matter that much. Figured I’d wait.
Peggy Carter: For what?
Steve Rogers: The right partner.
[They pull up by an antiques shop and get out of the car.]
Peggy Carter: This way.
Steve Rogers: What are we doing here?
Peggy Carter: Follow me. [They go inside.]
Antique Store Owner: Wonderful weather this morning isn’t it?
Peggy Carter: Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.
[Peggy leads Steve into the hidden lab to Dr. Erskine and his team in a big circular room filled with machinery and a pod in the middle.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Good morning. [he shakes Steve’s hand and sombody takes a photograph] Please, not now. [The photographer walks away, Steve looks at the pod] Are you ready? [Steve nods.] Good. Take off your shirt, your tie and your hat.
[In the adjacent observation chamber filled with officials.]
Col. Chester Phillips: Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.
Senator Brandt: Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?
Col. Chester Phillips: We needed access to the city’s power grid. Of course, if you’d given me the generators I requisitioned…
Senator Brandt: A lot of people are asking for funds, Colonel. [referring to his company] Oh, this is…
Heinz Kruger: Fred Clemson, State Department. [He shakes Phillips’ hand] If this project of yours comes through, we’d like to see it used for something other than headlines.
Senator Brandt: [looing down into the chamber at Steve] Jesus. Somebody get that kid a sandwich.
[In the chamber Steve has climbed into the pod and lain down.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Comfortable?
Steve Rogers: It’s a little big. You save me any of that schnapps?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Not as much as I should have. Sorry. Next time. Mr. Stark, how are your levels?
Howard Stark: Levels at 100%.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Good.
Howard Stark: We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn, but we are ready as we’ll ever be.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Agent Carter? Don’t you think you would be more comfortable in the booth?
Peggy Carter: Oh, yes. Of course. Sorry.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Good. [He takes a microphone and taps it.] Do you hear me? is this on? [to the small group gathered to watch Steve being prepared to become a super-solider] Ladies and gentlemen, today we take not another step towards annihilation, but the first step on the path to peace. We begin with a series of micro injections into the subjects major muscle groups. The serum infusion will cause immediate cellular change. And then to stimulate growth, the subject will be saturated with Vita-Rays.
Steve Rogers: [after preliminary injection] That wasn’t so bad.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: That was penicillin. [to the others] Serum infusion beginning in five, four, three, two, one. [The serum is injected into Steve] Now, Mr. Stark. [Stark lowers a leaver, the pod moves upright and encloses Steve inside.] [knocking on the capsule that they’ve locked Steven in for the procedure to change him] Steven, can you hear me?
Steve Rogers: It’s probably too late to go to the bathroom, right?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [turns to Stark] We will proceed.
Howard Stark: [manages the controls] That’s ten percent. Twenty percent. Thirty. That’s 40 %.
SSR Doctor: Vital signs are normal.
Howard Stark: That’s 50 %. Sixty. Seventy.
[as Steve is screaming in pain as he is receiving the vita rays]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Steven!
Peggy Carter: Shut it down.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Steven! [he knocks on the pod]
Peggy Carter: Shut it down!
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark! Turn it off! Kill it! Kill the reactor!
Steve Rogers: No! Don’t! I can do this!
Howard Stark: Eighty. Ninety. That’s 100 %. [Everything overloads until the reactor closes itself down.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Mr. Stark? [Stark opens the pod]
[after being transformed into a super-soldier]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Steven. Steven.
Col. Chester Phillips: The son of a bitch did it. [as everyone poors out of the observation chamber Kruger leaves a small, metal object like a cigarett case behind.]
Steve Rogers: [As he stumbles out of the pod supported by Stark and Erskine] I did it.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah, yeah. I think we did it.
Howard Stark: We actually did it.
Peggy Carter: How do you feel?
Steve Rogers: Taller.
Peggy Carter: You look taller.
Col. Chester Phillips: How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?
Senator Brandt: I can think of some folks in Berlin who are about to get very nervous. Congratulations, Doctor. [He shakes hands with Erskine.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Thank you, sir.
[Kruger detonates the bomb in the observation room and uses the confusion to steal the last vial of the serum.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Stop him! [Kruger shoots him and flees with Peggy chasing after him]
[Steve kneels beside Erskine who points at Steve’s chest and dies.]
[Kruger shoots his way to a get-away-car but soon after he drives away, Peggy shoots the driver and the car crashes into a taxi so Kruger changes cars.]
Taxi Driver: What are you doing? Buddy, are you all right? Hey, this guy’s been shot!
[Kruger drives off in the taxi, straight towards Peggy. She shoots at him but he just ducks and keeps going. Steve shoves her out of the way.]
Peggy Carter. I had him!
Steve Rogers: Sorry! [he runs after the cab] [While chasing the car he loses control over his new power and crashes into a bridalwear store.] I’m sorry. [he runs out into a street full of cars] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[Steve catches up to Kruger’s car a the pier and causes him to lose control. Kruger gets out of the car and takes a young boy hostage.]
Mother: No! No! Not my son!
Young Boy: Stop it!
Mother: Don’t hurt him!
Heinz Kruger: Get back! [Kruger with the boy dangling in his arms runs away.]
Young Boy: Let me go!
Mother: Let go of my son! Don’t hurt him!
Steve Rogers: [as Kruger points a gun at the boy’s head.] Wait, don’t! Don’t! [Kruger points the gun at Steve and pulls the trigger, but the gun is empty. So instead he throws the boy into the water.] No! Don’t! [Kruger runs, Steve looks down at the boy.]
Young Boy: Go get him! I can swim!
[Kruger tries to escape in a submarine, but Steve jumps into the water, breaks the window an pulls Kruger out back onto dry land. As they struggle further the vial breaks.]
Steve Rogers: Who the hell are you?
Heinz Kruger: The first of many. Cut off one head, two more shall take its place. Hail HYDRA! [he pops a fake tooth loose and swallows it, he starts to foam at the mouth and then die]
[At HYDRA HQ]
Hutter: The Führer is not accustomed to being ignored, Herr Schmidt. He funds your research because you promised him weapons.
Schneider: You serve at his pleasure. He gave you this facility as a reward for your injuries.
Johann Schmidt: Reward? Call it what it is. Exile. I no longer reflect his image of Aryan perfection.
Roeder: You think this is about appearances? Your HYDRA division has failed to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year. And we had learned through local intelligence you had mounted a full-scale incursion into Norway.
Schneider: The Führer feels… How does he put it? "The Red Skull has been indulged long enough!"
Johann Schmidt: Gentlemen, you have come to see the results of our work. Let me show you. [They enter the lab.] Hitler speaks of a thousand-year Reich, but he cannot feed his army for a month. His troops spill their blood across every field in Europe. But still he is no closer to achieving his goals.
Roeder: And I suppose you still aim to end this war through magic?
Johann Schmidt: Science. But I understand your confusion. Great power has always baffled primitive men. HYDRA is assembling an arsenal to destroy my enemies in one stroke. Where ever they are, regardless of how many forces they possess. All in a matter of hours.
Roeder: Your enemies?
Johann Schmidt: My weapons contain enough destructive power to decimate every hostile capital on earth. Quite simply, gentlemen, I have harnessed the power of the Gods.
Schneider: Thank you, Schmidt.
Johann Schmidt: For what?
Schneider: For making it clear how obviously mad you are.
Hutter: [studying a map lying in Schmidt’s labor.] Berlin is on this map!
Johann Schmidt: So it is.
Hutter: You will be punished for your insolence! You will be brought before the Führer himself! [Schmidt kills them all with his new Tesseract-powered canon.]
Roeder: [screams before he’s desintegrated] Schmidt!!!
Johann Schmidt: My apolpgies, Doctor, but we both knew HYDRA could grow no further in Hitler’s shadow. Hail HYDRA.
HYDRA technicians: Hail HYDRA! [raising both arms to salute]
Dr. Arnim Zola: [when Schmidt turns to him] Hail HYDRA!
[At the SSR compound.]
Steve Rogers: [referring to the amount of blood samples taken from him] Think you got enough?
Peggy Carter: Any hope of reproducing a program is locked in your genetic code. But without Dr. Erskine, it could take years.
Steve Rogers: He deserved more than this.
Peggy Carter: If it could only work once, he’d be proud it was you.
[SSR tech lab with the Hydra submarine]
Senator Brandt: Colonel Phillips, my committee is demanding answers.
Col. Chester Phillips: Great. Why don’t we start with how a German spy got a ride to my secret installation in your car? [to Stark who is working on the submarine] What have we got here?
Howard Stark: Speaking modestly, I’m the best mechanical engineer in this country. But I don’t know what’s inside this thing or how it works. We’re not even close to this technology.
Senator Brandt: Then who is?
Col. Chester Phillips: HYDRA. I’m sure you’ve been reading our briefings.
Senator Brandt: I’m on a number of committees, Colonel.
Peggy Carter: HYDRA is the Nazi deep science division. It’s led by Johann Schmidt. But he has much bigger ambitions.
Col. Chester Phillips: HYDRA’s practically a cult. They worship Schmidt, they think he’s invincible.
Senator Brandt: So what are you gonna do about it?
Col. Chester Phillips: Spoke to the president this morning. As of today the SSR is being retasked.
Peggy Carter: Colonel?
Col. Chester Phillips: We are taking the fight to HYDRA. Pack your bags Agent Carter. You too, Stark. You’re flying to London tonight.
Steve Rogers: Sir, if you’re going after Schmidt, I want in.
Col. Chester Phillips: You’re an experiment. You’re going to Alamogordo.
Steve Rogers: The serum worked.
Col. Chester Phillips: I asked for an army and all I got was you. You are not enough.
Senator Brandt: [to Steve] With all due respect to the Colonel, I think we may be missing the point. I’ve seen you in action, Steve. More importantly, the country’s seen it. [to his aide] Paper.[the aide shows them the news paper (‘The New York Examiner’ Vol. XCVII No. 33.634, Wednesday, June 23, 1943), headlines: "Nazis in New York - mystery man saves child"] The enlistment lines have been around the block since your picture hit the newsstands. You don’t take a soldier, a symbol like that, and hide him in a lab. Son, do you want to serve your country on the most important battlefield of the war?
Steve Rogers: Sir, that’s all I want.
Senator Brandt: Then, congratulations. You just got promoted.
Steve Rogers: [backstage as Steve is getting dressed in super-hero costume] I don’t know if I can do this.
Brandt’s Aide: Nothing to it. Sell off a few bonds, bonds buy bullets, bullets kills Nazi’s. Bing bang boom. You’re an American hero.
Steve Rogers: It’s just not how I pictured getting there.
Brandt’s Aide: The senator’s got a lot of pull up on the hill. You play ball with us, you’ll be leading your own platoon in no time. Take the shield. [as Steve puts on his head mask he pushes Steve onto the stage]
USO Singer: Who’s strong and brave, here to save the American way?
Steve Rogers: [As women start to sing and dance in the background Steve reads:] Not all of us can storm a beach or drive a tank. But there’s still a way all of us can fight.
USO Singer: Who vows to fight like a man, for what’s right, night and day?
Steve Rogers: Series E Defence Bonds. Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy’s gun.
USO Singer: Who will campaign door-to-door for America? Carry the flag shore to shore for America? From Hoboken to Spokane, the star-spangeld man with a plan.
[Steve leads a group of men dressed as soldiers in front of a moving image.]
Director: Cut. Guys, don’t look ath the camera.
[back to a scene where he’s on tour.]
USO Singer: We can’t ignore there’s a threat and a war we must win.
Steve Rogers: Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy’s gun.
USO Singer: Who’ll hang a noose on the goose-stepping goons from Berlin? Who will redeem, heed the call for America? Who’ll rise or fall, give his all for America? Who’s here to prove that we can? The star-spangled man with a plan.
Steve Rogers: We all know this is about trying to win the war. We can’t do that without bullets and bandages, tanks and tents. That’s where you come in. Every bond you buy will help protect someone you love. [A men dressed as hitler sneaks up on him on the stage.]
Kids in USO Audience: Turn around! He’s right behind you!
Steve Rogers: Keep our boys armed and ready, and the Germans will think twice about trying to get the drop on us. [The man attacs him and gets fake-punched.]
USO Singer: Stalwart and steady and true, forcefull and ready to defend, the red, white, and blue. Who’ll give the Axis the sack and is smart as a fox? Far as an eagle will soar. Who’s making Adolf afraid to step out of his box? He knows what we’re fighting for. Who waked the giant that napped in America? We know it’s no one but Captain America. Who’ll finish what they began? Who’ll kick the Krauts to Japan? The star-spangled man with a aplan! [Scenes show how Captain America goes on tour around America, appears in comics and films, how he’s approached by multiple fans, and generally becomes more liked and famous.]
[Italy, November 1943, 5 miles from the front. Steve addresses a crowd of soldiers dressed in his super-hero costume]
Steve Rogers: How many of you ready to help me sock old Adolf on the jaw? [silence from the crowd of soldiers] Okay. Uh… I need a volunteer.
Army Heckler#1: I already volunteered! How do you think I got here? [the crowd of soldiers laugh] Bring back the girls! [there’s a cheer from the soldiers]
Steve Rogers: I think they only know the one song. But um…let me…I’ll…I’ll see what I can do.
Army Heckler#1: You do that, sweetheart.
Army Heckler#2: Nice boots, Tinker Bell! [the crowd of soldiers laugh]
Steve Rogers: Come on, guys. We’re all on the same team here.
Army Heckler#3: Hey, Captain! Sign this! [he stands turns and pulls his pants down and the crowd starts to throw things at Steve.]
Army Heckler#4: Bring back the girls! [The women run on stage and the crowd cheers.]
Brandt’s Aide: [backstage to Steve] Don’t worry, pal. They’ll warm up to you. Don’t worry.
[Later, Steve sits on the edge of the stage sketching as rain pours down in the background.]
Peggy Carter: Hello, Steve.
Steve Rogers: [He turns and looks up at Peggy.] Hi.
Peggy Carter: Hi.
Steve Rogers: What are you doin’ here?
Peggy Carter: Officially I’m not here at all. That was quite a performance.
Steve Rogers: Yeah. Uh… I had to improvise a little bit. Crowds I’m used to are usually more uh… twelve.
Peggy Carter: I understand you’re "America’s New Hope"?
Steve Rogers: Bond sales take a ten percent bump in every state I visit.
Peggy Carter: Is that Senator Brandt I hear?
Steve Rogers: At least he’s got me doin’ this. Phillips would have had be stuck in lab.
Peggy Carter: And these are your only two options? A lab rat or a dancing monkey? You were meant for more than this, you know? [Steve goes to respond but hesitates] What?
Steve Rogers: You know for the longest time I dreamed about coming overseas and being on the front lines. Serving my country. I finally get everything I wanted, and I’m wearing tights. [Honking in the background as an ambulance arrives with wounded soldiers. Steve and Peggy turn around to watch.] They look like they’ve been through hell.
Peggy Carter: These men more than most. Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano. Two hundred men went up against him and less than fifty returned. Your audience contained what was left of the one-oh-seventh. The rest were killed or captured.
Steve Rogers: The one-oh-seventh?
Peggy Carter: What?
Steve Rogers: Come on! [They run to a tent.] Colonel Phillips.
Col. Chester Phillips: Well, if it isn’t the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan. And what is your plan today?
Steve Rogers: I need the casualty list from Azzano.
Col. Chester Phillips: You don’t get to give me orders, son.
Steve Rogers: I just need one name. Sergeant James Barnes from the hundred and seventh.
Col. Chester Phillips: [pointing to Peggy] You and I are gonna have a conversation later that you won’t enjoy.
Steve Rogers: Please tell me if he’s alive, sir. B-A-R…
Col. Chester Phillips: I can spell. [referring to Barnes] I have signed more of these condolence letters today than I would care to count. But the name does sound familiar. I’m sorry.
Steve Rogers: What about the others? Are you planning a rescue mission?
Col. Chester Phillips: Yeah! It’s called winning the war.
Steve Rogers: But if you know where they are, why not at least…?
Col. Chester Phillips: They’re thirty miles behind the lines. Through the most heavily fortified territory in Europe. We’d lose more men than we’d save. But I don’t expect you to understand that, because you’re a chorus girl.
Steve Rogers: I think I understand just fine.
Col. Chester Phillips: Well then understand it somewhere else. If I read the posters correctly, you got some place to be in thirty minutes. [as Phillips walks away Steve looks at the military map which shows where the men are]
Steve Rogers: Yes, sir. I do.
Col. Chester Phillips: [To Peggy] If you have something to say, right now is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.
Peggy Carter: [She follows Steve to his tent where he starts to change and pack some things.] What do you plan to do? Walk to Austria?
Steve Rogers: If that’s what it takes.
Peggy Carter: You heard the Colonel, your friend is most likely dead.
Steve Rogers: You don’t know that.
Peggy Carter: Even so, he’s devising a strategy. If he detects…
Steve Rogers: By the time he’s done that, it could be too late! [He walks out to a jeep.] You told me you thought I was meant for more than this. Did you mean that?
Peggy Carter: Every word.
Steve Rogers: Then you gotta let me go. [He gets in the jeep.]
Peggy Carter: I can do more than that.
[backstage with the USO girls]
Brandt’s Aide: On stage, girls. Five minutes!
USO girl: Where’s my helmet?
Brandt’s Aide: Has anyone seen Rogers?
[Peggy and Steve in a plane piloted by Stark.]
Peggy Carter: The HYDRA camp is in Krausberg, tucked between these two mountain ranges. It’s a factory of some kind.
Howard Stark: We should be able to drop you right on the doorstep.
Steve Rogers: Just get me as close as you can. [referring to Stark and Peggy helping him] You know, you two are gonna be in a lot of trouble at the lab.
Peggy Carter: And you won’t?
Steve Rogers: Where I’m goin’, if anybody yells at me I can just shoot ‘em.
Peggy Carter: They will undoubtedly shoot back.
Steve Rogers: Well, let’s hope it’s good for somethin’. [He knocks at his shield.]
Howard Stark: Agent Carter, if we’re not in too much of a hurry I thought we could stop off in Lucerne for a late night fondue. [Peggy looks awkwardly at Steve who’s getting ready to parachute.]
Peggy Carter: Stark is the best civilian pilot I’ve ever seen. He’s mad enough to brave this airspace, we’re lucky to have him.
Steve Rogers: So are you two…? Do you…? Fondue?
Peggy Carter: [She ignores Steve’s akward and confused rambling.] This is your transponder. Activate it when you’re ready and the signal will lead us straight to you.
Steve Rogers: Are you sure this thing works?
Howard Stark: It’s been tested more than you, pal. [as their plane is being attacked Steve goes towards the opened door of the plane to jump]
Peggy Carter: Get back here! We’re taking you all the way in.
Steve Rogers: As soon as I’m free, you turn this thing around and get the hell outta here!
Peggy Carter: You can’t give me orders!
Steve Rogers: The hell I can’t! I’m a Captain! [he looks at her and then jumps out of the plane]
[In the Hydra factory located in Italy, Schmidt and Zola walk side by side through the workspace.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: As you can see, production of the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule, even with components of this size.
Johann Schmidt: Increase the output by 60 % and see to it our other facilities do the same.
Dr. Arnim Zola: But the prisoners, I’m not sure they have the strength.
Johann Schmidt: Then use up what strength they have left, Doctor. There are always more workers.
Dr. Arnim Zola: [To someone approaching him with a clip board] Not now!
[At the cells where prisoners are lead into. One of the guards knocks the hat from Dumdum Dugan’s head.]
Dum Dum Dugan: You know, Fritz, one of these days, I’m gonna have a stick of my own.
[Steve runs through the dark woods until he finds a road where trucks a driving by. He gets into the back of one of them and finds himself face to face with two Hydra guards.]
Steve Rogers: Fellas.
HYDRA guards: Ah!
[After Steve snuck into the HYDRA factory and stole a blue shining cartridge, he finds some of the captured American soldiers]
Gabe Jones: Who are you supposed to be?
Steve Rogers: I’m… Captain America.
James Montgomery Falsworth: I beg your pardon?
Dum Dum Dugan: [After Steve has unlocked their cells and prisoner start pooring out, he says to a Jim Morita, a Japanese looking man] What, are we taking everybody?
Jim Morita: [takes out his dog tags] I’m from Fresno, Ace.
Steve Rogers: Is there anybody else? I’m looking for a Sergeant James Barnes.
James Montgomery Falsworth: There’s an isolation ward in the factory, but no one’s ever come back from it.
Steve Rogers: All right. The tree line is northwest, 80 yards past the gate. Get out fast and give ‘em hell. I’ll meet you guys in the clearing with anybody else I find.
Gabe Jones: Wait! You know what you’re doin’?
Steve Rogers: Yeah. I’ve knocked out Adolf Hitler over two hundred times.
[The prisoners escape into the compound, overpowering the guards with their sheer numbers. Dernier picks up one of the new Tesseract-powered HYDRA guns.]
Jim Morita: You know how to use that thing? [Dernier shoots, blowing up a wall] Okay.
[HYDRA factory command center]
Johann Schmidt: [stares at a surveillance screen] What is happening? [He presses an alarm.]
[back to the prisoners in the compound, Dum Dum and Jones overtake a small tank.]
Dum Dum Dugan: Hey. Not exactly a Buick.
Gabe Jones: [points at the controls] That one. Zündung. (Ignition.)
Dum Dum Dugan: Zündung?
James Montgomery Falsworth: [jumps into the tank] Get this thing going, Dugan!
Dum Dum Dugan: [to Jones] I didn’t know you spoke German.
Gabe Jones: Three semesters at Howards, switched to French, girls much cuter.
Dum Dum Dugan: Didn’t ask for the resume.
[In the HYDRA control room Schmidt watches Steve on the monitors and decides to activate the self destruct sequence which are counting down from 7 minutes.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: No, no! What are you doing?
Johann Schmidt: Our forces are outmatched. [Zola looks at the screens, then runs out of the room.]
[Dernier and Morita running through the compound with other prisoners.]
Jim Morita: Keep moving! Grab those grenades!
[Schmidt secures the Tesseract while Zola packs the blueprints of his design. Steve sees him in the corridor but hesitates to chase him when he hears someone.]
James Barnes: Sergeant. 32557…
Steve Rogers: [he finds Barnes strapped to a chair in one of Schmidt’s testing labs] Bucky? Oh, my God. [he unstraps him from the chair]
James Barnes: Is that…
Steve Rogers: It’s me. It’s Steve.
James Barnes: Steve?
Steve Rogers: Come on.
James Barnes: Steve.
Steve Rogers: I thought you were dead.
James Barnes: I thought you were smaller. [referring to Steve’s change of appearance]
Steve Rogers: Come on.
James Barnes: What happened to you?
Steve Rogers: I joined the Army. [referring to Steve’s undergoing change to a super-soldier]
James Barnes: Did it hurt?
Steve Rogers: A little.
James Barnes: Is it permanent?
Steve Rogers: So far.
[They flee through the exploding factory until they meet Schmidt and Zola.]
Johann Schmidt: Captain America! How exciting! I’m a great fan of your films. So Dr. Erskine managed it after all. Not exactly an improvement, but still impressive. [Steve punches Schmidt hard in the face]
Steve Rogers: You’ve got no idea.
Johann Schmidt: Haven’t I? [He goes to hit Steve but Steve protects himself with his shield. As they fight, Zola pulls a leaver and the catwalk they are standing on retracts to either side seperating them.] No matter what lies Erskine told you, you see I was his greatest success! [he peels off the skin on his face to reveal that he is the Red Skull]
James Barnes: [to Steve referring to Schmidt’s skinless face] You don’t have one of those, do you?
Johann Schmidt: You are deluded, Captain. You pretend to be a simple soldier, but in reality you are just afraid to admit that we have left humanity behind. Unlike you, I embrace it proudly. Without fear!
Steve Rogers: Then how come you’re running? [Schmidt and Zola continue their escape and so do Steve and Bucky.] Come on, let’s go. Up.
[Schmidt and Zola in an elevator.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: Sir? Are we going to the roof? [The doors open to reveal a one-man-plane] What about me? Where will I sit?
Johann Schmidt: [gives Zola his car keys] Not a scratch, Doctor. Not a scratch. [We see Schmidt and Zola escaping.]
[Steve and Bucky on a catwalk, beneath them everything is on fire, they have to reach the other side of the room over a thin gantry.]
Steve Rogers: Let’s go. One at a time. [Bucky reaches the other side but the gantry collapses behind him.]
James Barnes: Gotta be a rope or something!
Steve Rogers: Just go! Get out of here!
James Barnes: No! Not without you! [Steve jumps over the chasm.]
[In the Amry camp Phillips is dictating a letter to a Corporal.]
Col. Chester Phillips: Senator Brandt, I regret to report that Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing behind enemy lines on the third. Aerial reconnaissance has proven unfruitful. As a result, I must declare Captain Rogers killed in action. Period.
Peggy Carter: The last surveillance flight is back. No sign of activity.
Col. Chester Phillips: Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.
Corporal: Yes, sir. [he leaves]
Col. Chester Phillips: I can’t touch Stark. He’s rich and he’s the Army’s number one weapons contractor. You are neither one.
Peggy Carter: With respect, sir, I don’t regret my actions. And I don’t think Captain Rogers did either.
Col. Chester Phillips: What makes you think I give a damn about your opinions. I took a chance with you, Agent Carter. And now America’s golden boy and a lot of other good men are dead, cause you had a crush.
Peggy Carter: It wasn’t that. I had faith.
Col. Chester Phillips: Well, I hope that’s a big comfort to you when they shut this division down. [Soldier start running and talking exitedly in the background.] What the hell’s going on out there? [They follow the crowd to the edge of the camp where Steve’S arriving with the freed prisoners.]
Man#1: Look who it is! [everyone cheers]
Steve Rogers: [salutes to Phillips] Some of theres men need medical attention.
Man#2: Medic, we got wounded.
Medic. Right over here.
Steve Rogers: I’d like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.
Col. Chester Phillips: That won’t be necessary.
Steve Rogers: Yes, sir.
Col. Chester Phillips: [he turns and walks away from Steve and he notices Peggy] Faith, huh?
Peggy Carter: [to Steve] You’re late.
Steve Rogers: [holding up the broken transponder] Couldn’t call my ride.
James Barnes: [to the men] Hey! Let’s hear it for Captain America. [more cheering]
Senator Brandt: [somewhere in America talking to a small crowd] I am honoured to present this medal for valour to my personal friend, Captain America! [he turns around but no one is there.] Captain America! [still nothing] Captain, that’s your cue! [his aide comes out, whispering something to him]
General: [sitting in the crowd talking quietly to the man next to him] I thought he’d be taller. [misunderstanding the aide to be Captain America]
[Allied HQ in London]
Steve Rogers: The fifth one was here in Poland, right near the Baltic. [he marks it on a map] And the sixth one was… about here, 30, 40 miles west of the Maginot Line. [a soldier takes the map away] I just got a quick look.
Peggy Carter: Well, nobody’s perfect. [they walk over to Phillips and another map]
Steve Rogers: These are the weapon factories we know about. Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra shipped all the parts to another facility that isn’t on this map.
Col. Chester Phillips: Agent Carter, coordinate with MI6. I want every Allied eyeball looking for that main Hydra base.
Peggy Carter: What about us?
Col. Chester Phillips: We are gonna set a fire under Johann Schmidt’s ass. What do you say, Rogers? It’s your map, you think you can wipe Hydra off of it?
Steve Rogers: Yes, sir. I’ll need a team.
Col. Chester Phillips: We’re already putting together the best men.
Steve Rogers: With all due respect, sir. So am I.
[in a bar]
Dum Dum Dugan: So, let’s get this straight.
Gabe Jones: We barely got out of there alive, and you want us to go back?
Steve Rogers: Pretty much.
James Montgomery Falsworth: Sounds rather fun, actually.
Jim Morita: [belches] I’m in.
Gabe Jones: [Dernier and Gabe speaking French, Dernier laughs, they shake hands] We’re in.
Dum Dum Dugan: Hell, I’ll always fight. But you got to do one thing for me.
Steve Rogers: What’s that?
Dum Dum Dugan: Open a tab.
Jim Morita: Well, that was easy.
Steve Rogers: [Steve goes over to the bar.] Another round.
Barkeeper: Where are they putting all this stuff?
James Barnes: [Steve joins Bucky at the barcounter. In the background everyone's singing "There's a Tavern in Town"[1]] See? I told you. They’re all idiots.
Steve Rogers: How about you? You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death?
James Barnes: Hell, no. That little guy from Brooklyn who was too dumb not to run away from a fight. I’m following him. But you’re keeping the outfit, right?
Steve Rogers: You know what? It’s kind of growing on me.
Peggy Carter: [The singing in the bar stops as Peggy in a tight fitting, deep-red dress walks in.] Captain.
Steve Rogers: Agent Carter.
James Barnes: Ma’am.
Peggy Carter: Howard has some equipment for you to try. Tomorrow morning?
Steve Rogers: Sounds good.
Peggy Carter: I see you top squad is prepping for duty.
James Barnes: You don’t like music?
Peggy Carter: I do, actually. I might even, when this is all over, go dancing.
James Barnes: Then what are we waiting for?
Peggy Carter. The right partner. 0800, Captain.
Steve Rogers: Yes, ma’m. I’ll be there.
James Barnes: [referring to the rejection he got from Peggy about going dancing with him] I’m invisible. I’m…I’m turning into you. It’s like some horrible dream.
Steve Rogers: Don’t take it so hard. Maybe she’s got a friend. [whilst waiting to see Stark]
Howard Stark: [Morning, by a glass chamber, Stark examines the Hydra cartridge] Emission signature is unusual. Alpha and beta ray neutral. Though I doubt Rogers picked up on that. Seems harmless enough. Hard to see what all the fuss is about. [He removes a glowing pellet. The blast sends Stark and his engineer flying across the room.] Write that down.
[Somewhere else in the building]
Steve Rogers: [to Private Lorraine] Excuse me. I’m looking for Mr. Stark.
Pvt. Lorraine: He’s in with Colonel Phillips. Of course you’re welcome to wait. [Steve perches on the edge of a desk to wait] I read about what you did. [she holds up the newspaper showing his rescue mission]
Steve Rogers: Oh! The…yeah! Well, that’s you know? Just doin’ what needed to be done.
Pvt. Lorraine: Sounded like more than that. You saved nearly four hundred men.
Steve Rogers: Really, it’s not a big deal.
Pvt. Lorraine: Tell that to their wives. [Steve gets nervous as she walks up to him]
Steve Rogers: Uh…I don’t think they were all married.
Pvt. Lorraine: You’re a hero.
Steve Rogers: Well, that…you know? That…that depends on the definition of it really. [she grabs hold of his tie]
Pvt. Lorraine: The women of America, they owe you their thanks. And uh…seeing as they’re not here. [drags him to the corner of the office and kisses him]
Peggy Carter: [she walks in] Captain! [Steve and Pvt. Lorraine separate] We’re ready for you. If you’re not otherwise occupied. [annoyed, she turns and walks ahead]
Steve Rogers: Agent Carter, wait.
Peggy Carter: Looks like finding a partner wasn’t that hard after all.
Steve Rogers: Peggy, that’s not what you thought it was.
Peggy Carter: I don’t think anything, Captain. Not one thing. You always wanted to be soldier and now you are. Just like all the rest.
Steve Rogers: Well, what about you and Stark? How do I know you two haven’t been… fonduing?
Peggy Carter: [she turns to look at him] You still don’t know a bloody thing about women!
[In Stark’s lab]
Howard Stark: Fondue is just cheese and bread, my friend.
Steve Rogers: Really? I didn’t think…
Howard Stark: Nor should you, pal. The moment you think you know what’s goin’ on in a woman’s head, it’s the moment your goose is well and truly cooked. Me, I concentrate on work. Which at the moment is about making sure you and your men do not get killed. Carbon polymer. [referring to a piece of cloth lying on the table] Should withstand your average German bayonet. Although Hydra’s not going to attack you with a pocket knife. [referring to Steve’s Captain America shield] I hear you’re uh… kinda attached?
Steve Rogers: It’s handier than you might think.
Howard Stark: I took the liberty of coming up with some options. [shows him a few shields] This one’s fun. She’s been fitted with electrical relays. It’ll allow you to…
Steve Rogers: What about this one? [he picks up a round silver looking shield]
Howard Stark: No! No! That’s just a prototype.
Steve Rogers: What’s it made of?
Howard Stark: Vibranium. It’s stronger than steel and a third of the weight. It’s completely vibration absorbent.
Steve Rogers: How come it’s not a standard issue?
Howard Stark: That’s the rarest metal on earth. What you’re holding there? That’s all we’ve got.
Peggy Carter: [as Steve is checking out the shield made out of Vibranium] You quite finished, Mr. Stark? I’m sure the Captain has some unfinished business.
Steve Rogers: [holds up the Vibranium shield against him] What do you think? [Peggy picks up gun and shoots it at Steve as he quickly holds up the shield to protect himself]
Peggy Carter: Yes. I think it works. [she puts the gun down and walks out of the lab, Steve and Howard looking at her stunned]
Steve Rogers: I had some ideas about the uniform. [gives Stark a piece of paper]
Howard Stark: [takes it] Whatever you want, pal.
[Montage of Captain America and his Howling Commandos fighting Hydra.]
[At the site of a destroyed Hydra base]
Johann Schmidt: You are failing! We are close to an offensive network that will shake the planet. And yet we are continually delayed, because you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield!
Dr. Arnim Zola: This is hardly my area of expertise. I…I merely develop the weapons. I…I cannot fire them.
Johann Schmidt: Finish your mission, Doctor. Before the American finishes his.
Guard: [two guards arrive with the facility manager] Sir!
Facility Manager: I’m sorry, Herr Schmidt. We fought to the last man.
Johann Schmidt: Evidently not. [kills him]
James Barnes: [On a snow covered mountain the Howling Commandos prepare to zipline onto the train.] Remember when I made you ride the Cyclone at Coney Island?
Steve Rogers: Yeah, I and I threw up?
James Barnes: This isn’t payback, is it?
Steve Rogers: Now why would I do that?
Gabe Jones: We were right. Dr. Zola’s on the train. Hydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle. Wherever he’s going, they must need him bad.
James Montgomery Falsworth: Let’s get going, because they’re moving like the devil.
Steve Rogers: We only got about a 10-second window. You miss that window, we’re bugs on a windshield.
James Montgomery Falsworth: Mind the gap.
Dum Dum Dugan: Better get moving, bugs!
Jacques Dernier: Maintenant! (Now!) [ Steve, Bucky and Gabe zippline onto the train.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: [watching Steve on a monitor, fighting his way through the train] Stop him! Fire again!
James Barnes: [after Steve helps him out] I had him on the ropes.
Steve Rogers: I know you did. [another trooper with a blaster appears] Get down!
Dr. Arnim Zola: Fire again! Kill him! Now!
Steve Rogers: [Bucky’s been blasted through a hole and is now hanging outside the train.] Bucky! Hang on! Grab my hand! NO!
[Allied HQ in London, Phillips brings a tray of food to Zola after he’s been captured and imprisoned]
Col. Chester Phillips: Sit down.
Dr. Arnim Zola: What is this?
Col. Chester Phillips: Steak.
Dr. Arnim Zola: What is in it?
Col. Chester Phillips: Cow. Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is to get ahold of a prime cut like that out here?
Dr. Arnim Zola: I don’t eat meat.
Col. Chester Phillips: Why not?
Dr. Arnim Zola: It disagrees with me.
Col. Chester Phillips: How about cyanide? Does that give you the rumbly tummy too? Every Hydra agent that we’ve tried to take alive has crunched a little pill before we can stop him. But not you. So, here’s my brilliant theory. [Phillips starts eating the steak.] You wanna live.
Dr. Arnim Zola: You’re trying to intimidate me, Colonel.
Col. Chester Phillips: I bought you dinner. [passes him a piece of paper which Zola reads out loud]
Dr. Arnim Zola: ‘Given the variable information he has provided, and in exchange for his full cooperation, Dr. Zola is being remanded to Switzerland.’
Col. Chester Phillips: I sent that message to Washington this morning. Of course it was encoded. You guys haven’t broken those codes, have you? That would be awkward.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Schmidt will know this is a lie.
Col. Chester Phillips: He’s gonna kill you anyway, Doc. You’re a liability. You know more about Schmidt than anyone. And the last guy you cost us was Captain Rogers’ closest friend. So, I wouldn’t count on the very best of protection. There’s you or Schmidt. It’s just the hand you’ve been dealt.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Schmidt believes he walks in the foot steps of the Gods.
Col. Chester Phillips: Mmm.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Only the world itself will satisfy him.
Col. Chester Phillips: You do realize that’s nuts, don’t you?
Dr. Arnim Zola: But the sanity of the plan is of no consequence.
Col. Chester Phillips: And why is that?
Dr. Arnim Zola: Because he can do it!
Col. Chester Phillips: What’s his target?
Dr. Arnim Zola: His target… is everywhere.
[Hydra main base, Schmidt addresses his soldier]
Johann Schmidt: Tomorrow, Hydra will stand master of the world. Born to victory on the wings of the Valkyrie. Our enemies weapons will be powerless against us. If they shoot down one plane, hundreds more will rain fire upon them! If they cut off one head, two more shall take its place. Hail Hydra! [his soldiers all start saluting and shouting ‘Hail Hydra’]
[In London, a part of the city destroyed by bombs, formerly the bar where Steve enlisted the Howling Commandos. Peggy follows the voice of a radio through the rubble.]
Man on the Radio: Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area. Please wait for the all-clear. Your attention, please. All citizens shall remain indoors until further notice. Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area.
Steve Rogers: [when Peggy finds him he’s pouring himself some drink] Dr. Erskine said that… the serum wouldn’t just effect my muscles, it would effect my cells. Create a protective system of regeneration and healing. Which means um…I can’t get drunk. Did you know that?
Peggy Carter: Your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person. He thought it could be one of the side effects. [referring to Barnes getting killed] It wasn’t your fault.
Steve Rogers: Did you read the reports?
Peggy Carter: Yes.
Steve Rogers: Then you know that’s not true.
Peggy Carter: You did everything you could. Did you believe in your friend? Did you respect him? [Steve looks at her as if to say yes] Then stop blaming yourself. Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice. He damn well must have thought you were worth it.
Steve Rogers: I’m goin’ after Schmidt. I’m not gonna stop till all of Hydra is dead or captured.
Peggy Carter: You won’t be alone.
[The team prepare a battle plan to take down Red Skull at his headquarters]
Col. Chester Phillips: Johann Schmidt belongs in a bug house. He thinks he’s a God. He’s willing to blow up half the world to prove it, starting with the USA.
Howard Stark: Schmidt’s working with powers beyond our capabilities. He gets across the Atlantic, he will wipe out the entire eastern sea board in an hour.
Gabe Jones: How much time we got?
Col. Chester Phillips: According to my new best friend, under twenty four hours.
Jaques Dernier: Where is he now?
Col. Chester Phillips: Hydra’s last base is here. [holding a photo he points to the base] In the Alps. Five hundred feet below the surface.
Jim Morita: So, what are we supposed to do. I mean, it’s not like we can just knock on the front door.
Steve Rogers: Why not? That’s exactly what we’re gonna do.
[after Steve has been captured by Hydra soldiers and brought to Schmidt’s weapon lab]
Johann Schmidt: Arrogance may not be a uniquely American trait, but I must say you do it better than anyone. But there are limits to what even you can do, Captain. Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?
Steve Rogers: He told me you were insane.
Johann Schmidt: Ah. He resented my genius and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine. But he gave you everything. So, what made you so special?
Steve Rogers: Nothin’. I’m just a kid from Brooklyn. [after Schmidt has beaten him] I can do this all day.
Johann Schmidt: Oh, of course you can. Of course. But unfortunately I am on a tight schedule. [Schmidt takes out his cube-energy pistol and points it at Steve]
Steve Rogers: So am I! [just then Steve’s team crashes through the windows of the weapons lab]
James Montgomery Falsworth: Rogers! You might need this! [He throws Steve his shield.]
Steve Rogers: Thanks! [Steve makes his way through the Hydra base which has fallen into chaos with the arrival of more Allied soldiers.]
Jim Morita: [into his comm] We’re in! Assault team, go!
Col. Chester Phillips: [standing outside listening to Morita] Move out! [the soldiers start running towards the Hydra base] Keep your spacing!
[In the Hydra base]
Hydra Soldier: Cutt off one head, two more shall… [he’s killed by Phillips]
Col. Chester Phillips: Let’s go find two more!
[As Steve chases Schmidt he is confronted by a Hydra soldier with flame throwers and saved by Peggy]
Steve Rogers: [after Peggy has killed the Hydra soldier] You’re late.
Peggy Carter: Weren’t you about to…
Steve Rogers: Right. [Steve continues his chase, but after Schmidt has boarded the Valkyrie Steve is not fast enough to catch the plane. Behin him Phillips and Peggy appear in a car and pick him up to chase the plane on the runway.] Keep it steady! [Just as Steve is about to leap from the roadster onto Schmidt’s plane Peggy stops him]
Peggy Carter: Wait! [she kisses him] Go get him. [Steve surprised by the kiss looks at Phillips]
Col. Chester Phillips: I’m not kissin’ you!
[Inside the Valkyrie there are multiple figher planes with their targets written on them: Boston, Chicago, New York. After Steve has managed to disable the fighter planes and their pilots he enters the cockpit where Schmidt is waiting.]
Johann Schmidt: You don’t give up, do you?
Steve Rogers: Nope! [They fight]
Johan Schmidt: You could have the power of the gods! Yet you wear a flag on your chest and think you fight a battle of nations! I have seen the future, Captain! There are no flags!
Steve Rogers: Not my future! [He flings his shield at Schmidt who is thrown into the cubic console.]
Johan Schmidt/Red Skull: What have you done? No. [he picks up the cube and energy starts to pour from it, revealing a window into space. A stream of blue energy engulfes Schmidt and takes him into the sky. The cube falls to the ground and burns through it until it falls into the sea below.]
[Steve takes over the plane’s controls, on a screen he reads "Ziel New York City" (target New York City), and tries the radio which is picked up by the Hydra control tower occupied by Peggy, Phillips and Morita.]
Steve Rogers: Come in. This is Captain Rogers. Do you read me?
Jim Morita: Captain Rogers, what is your… [Peggy takes his place]
Peggy Carter: Steve, is that you? Are you alright?
Steve Rogers: Peggy! Schmidt’s dead.
Peggy Carter: What about the plane?
Steve Rogers: That’s a little bit tougher to explain.
Peggy Carter: Give me your coordinates, I’ll find you a safe landing site.
Steve Rogers: There’s not going to be a safe landing. But I can try and force it down.
Peggy Carter: I’ll get Howard on the line, he’ll know what to do.
Steve Rogers: There’s not enough time. This thing’s moving too fast and it’s heading for New York. [referring to Schmidt’s plane, speaking through the plane’s control] I gotta put her in the water.
Peggy Carter: Please, don’t do this. We have time. We can work it out.
Steve Rogers: Right now I’m in the middle of nowhere. If I wait any longer a lot of people are gonna die. Peggy, this is my choice. [as he’s forcing the plane down towards the water] Peggy?
Peggy Carter: I’m here.
Steve Rogers: I’m gonna need a rain check on that dance.
Peggy Carter: [with tears in her eyes] Alright. A week, next Saturday, at the Stork Club.
Steve Rogers: You got it.
Peggy Carter: Eight o’clock on the dot. Don’t you dare be late. Understood?
Steve Rogers: You know, I still don’t know how to dance.
Peggy Carter: I’ll show you how. Just be there.
Steve Rogers: We’ll have the band play somethin’ slow. I’d hate to step on your… [the line goes static and Peggy begins to cry]
Peggy Carter: Steve? Steve? Steve?
[Later, the world celebrates the victory over Nazi-Germany. The Howling Commandos are in a bar.]
James Montgomery Falsworth: To the Captain. [They drink]
[Stark on his search for the Valkyrie in the arctic sea on a ship. They’ve found the Tesseract.]
Stark’s Engineer: Sir? [Stark steps to him and watches on a screen how a submarine grabs the cube.]
Howard Stark: [to the captain] Take us to the next grid point.
Stark’s Engineer: But there’s not trace of wreckage. And the energy signature stops here.
Howard Stark: Just keep looking.
[After Steve has been missing for some time, we see him awaken in a 1940’s hospital and he can hear a baseball game on an old radio when a woman walks into the room]
Dodgers Announcer: [over the radio] Curve ball, high and outside for ball one. So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4. And the crowd well knows that with one swing of his bat, this fellow’s capable of making it a brand-new game again. Just an absolutely gorgeous day here at Ebbets Field. The Phillies have managed to tie up at 4-4. But the Dodgers have three men on. Pearson beaned Reiser in Philadelphia last month. Wouldn’t the youngster like a hit here to return the favour? Pete leans in. Here’s the pitch. Swung on. A line to the right. And it gets past Rizzo. Three runs will score. Reiser heads to third. Durocher’s going to wave him in. Here comes the relay, but they won’t get him. [the door opens and an agent walks in]
SHIELD Agent: Good morning. [she checks her watch] Or should I say, afternoon?
Steve Rogers: Where am I?
SHIELD Agent: You’re in a recovery room in New York city.
Dodgers Announcer: The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4. Oh, Dodgers! Everyone is on their feet. What a game we have here today, folks. What a game indeed.
Steve Rogers: [he looks at her suspiciously] Where am I really?
SHIELD Agent: I’m afraid I don’t understand.
Steve Rogers: The game, it’s from May, nineteen forty one. I know, cause I was there. [he gets up from the bed] Now, I’m gonna ask you again. Where am I?
SHIELD Agent: Captain Rogers… [she secretly pushes an alarm]
Steve Rogers: Who are you? [two soldiers in black uniform enter the room and Steve knocks them through the wall. Steve realizes that he’s on a some kind of made up set and he runs out of there.]
SHIELD Agent: Captain Rogers, wait! [into a comm] All agents, code 13! I repeat. All agents, code 13!
[Steve finds himself in 2011’s Time Square he looks around him in shock, numerous SUV’s encircle him and Fury steps out of one of the vehicles]
Nick Fury: At ease, soldier! Look, I’m sorry about that little show back there, but… we thought it best to break it to you slowly.
Steve Rogers: Break what?
Nick Fury: You’ve been asleep, Cap. For almost seventy years. [Steve looks around him in shock] You gonna be okay?
Steve Rogers: Yeah. Yeah. I just…I had a date.
[lines after end of credits; Steve’s is pummeling a punching bag in a gym and in anger knocks it off it’s chain, sending it flying across the room when Fury enters the gym]
Nick Fury: Trouble sleeping?
Steve Rogers: You’re here with a mission, sir?
Nick Fury: I am.
Steve Rogers: Trying to get me back in the world?
Nick Fury: Trying to save it.

[1991, a HYDRA base in a snowy landscape. A man enters a bunker and removes a red book marked with a black star.]
[A technician raises a cylindrical chamber, revealing Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier.]
[Bucky Barnes is secured in a chair, a mechanical device either side of his head causing him to scream in pain.]
Vasily Karpov: [speaking Russian] Желание. Ржавый. Семнадцать. Рассвет. Печь. Девять. Добросердечный. Возвращение на родину. Один. Грузовой вагон.[1] ([subtitled] Longing. Rusted. Seventeen. Daybreak. Furnace. Nine. Benign. Homecoming. One. Freight car.) Доброе утро, Солдат. ([subtitled] Good morning, Soldier.)
[Bucky Hesitates]
Bucky Barnes: Я готов отвечать. ([subtitled] Ready to comply.)
Vasily Karpov: У меня есть для тебя миссия. Санкционируй и Извлекай. Без свидетелей.([subtitled] I have a mission for you. Sanction and extract. No witnesses.)
[Night. A car is driving down a dirt road alone. The Winter Soldier is waiting at the side of the road with his motorcycle. As the car passes, the Winter Soldier follows. He comes alongside the car and disables it. It slams into a tree. The Winter Soldier brings the motorcycle back around and climbs off. He walks to the car trunk and rips it open, revealing a silver case containing several blue packets]
[Back at the HYDRA base]
Vasily Karpov: Отлично, Солдат. ([subtitled] Well done, Soldier.)
[Marvel Opening Credits]
[Lagos, present day]
[Wanda Maximoff, aka Scarlet Witch, adds sugar to a cup and stirs it. She looks around.]
Steve Rogers: [on radio] All right, what do you see?
Wanda Maximoff: Standard beat cops. Small station. Quiet street. It’s a good target.
Steve Rogers: There’s an ATM in the south corner, which means . . .
Wanda Maximoff: Cameras.
Steve Rogers: Both cross streets are one way.
Wanda Maximoff: So, compromised escape routes.
Steve Rogers: Means our guy doesn't care about being seen, he isn't afraid to make a mess on the way out. You see that Range Rover halfway up the block?
Wanda Maximoff: Yeah, the red one? It’s cute.
[Camera pans to show Natasha sitting two tables from Wanda]
Natasha Romanoff: [on radio] It's also bulletproof, which means private security, which means more guns, which means more headaches for somebody. Probably us.
Wanda Maximoff: You guys know I can move things with my mind, right?
Natasha Romanoff: Looking over your shoulder needs to become second nature.
Sam Wilson: Anybody ever tell you you're a little paranoid?
Natasha Romanoff: Not to my face. Why? Did you hear something?
Steve Rogers: Eyes on target, folks. This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow in six months. I don't want to lose him.
Sam Wilson: If he sees us coming that won't be a problem. He kind of hates us.
[A garbage truck is pushing its way through traffic, with no regard to pedestrians or other vehicles]
Steve Rogers: Sam, see that garbage truck? Tag it.
[From the back of Sam’s Falcon jet pack, a small drone, launches and flies down to scan the garbage truck.]
Sam Wilson: Give me X-ray.
[weight analysis: Cargo Weight: 13825 kgs. Max capacity.]
Sam Wilson: That truck’s loaded for max weight. And the driver’s armed.
Natasha Romanoff: It’s a battering ram.
Steve Rogers: Go now.
Wanda Maximoff: What?
Steve Rogers: He’s not hitting the police.
[INSTITUTE FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES]
[A man is sitting in the guard station. He looks over as the garbage truck is coming towards the gate. The driver jumps out, and the truck slams into the gateway. Two trucks rush into the compound through the newly-made entrance.]
[Soldiers in black armor emerge from the trucks, firing their rifles around the courtyard. Four soldiers fire gas canisters into the building. Soldiers wearing gas masks enter.]
[Steve arrives and takes out several of the soldiers.]
Steve Rogers: Body armor, AR-15's. I make seven hostiles.
[Sam flies in and up to a rooftop, spinning and using his wings to block gunfire. He takes out two soldiers.]
Sam Wilson: I make 5.
[Wanda arrives and flies over the rooftop and into the courtyard, blocking fire with her powers. She takes control of one soldier and lifts him upward.]
Wanda Maximoff: Sam.
[Sam glides down from the rooftop, catching the soldier on one of his wings.]
Sam Wilson: Four.
[Sam's drone flies by, scanning the inside of the building.]
Sam Wilson: Rumlow’s on the third floor.
Steve Rogers: Wanda, just like we practiced.
Wanda Maximoff: What about the gas?
Steve Rogers: Get it out.
[Wanda uses her powers to lift Steve up and through the window. He grabs a soldier and pulls off their gas mask]
[Rumlow is inside. He punches down the door. He knocks aside a technician and enters a room with a container labeled "bio-hazard."]
Brock Rumlow: Pack it up.
[In another area, Steve is behind a pillar. He throws his shield, and it bounces off the soldier and back to Steve. Meanwhile, Wanda is now using her powers to remove the gas from the building. Sam is exchanging fire with several soldiers.]
[Rumlow walks outside onto a balcony and sees that Steve’s team is here.]
Brock Rumlow: He’s here.
[Inside the building, Steve sees the vial missing.]
Steve Rogers: Rumlow has a biological weapon.
[Natasha is riding in on a motorcycle.]
Natasha Romanoff: (on radio) I’m on it.
[She jumps off the motorcycle and it skids toward a soldier. She takes out soldiers through hand-to-hand combat. Rumlow comes up behind her and grabs her collar, dragging her onto an armored vehicle. She electrocutes him.]
Brock Rumlow: I don't work like that no more.
[He throws her through the roof hatch into an armored vehicle, drops in a grenade, and shuts the hatch.]
Brock Rumlow: Fire in the hole.
Mercenary: No!
[Natasha takes out the soldiers inside, then grabs one to shield herself from the grenade. The doors blow open and she is thrown out.]
[Steve runs out onto the balcony and spots Rumlow.]
Steve Rogers: Sam. He's in an AFV heading north.
[Inside the AFV, Rumlow secures the biological weapon and hands it to a soldier.]
Brock Rumlow: Take this to the airstrip. We're not gonna outrun them. Lose the truck.
[The truck crashes into a nearby structure and Rumlow and the soldiers emerge.]
Mercenary #1: Where are you going to meet us?
Brock Rumlow: I’m not.
[Sam lands on the roof of a structure. He scans the area with his goggles.]
Sam Wilson: I got four, they're splitting up.
[Natasha rides through the crowd, back on her motorcycle. She abandons it again and runs across the hoods of cars, in pursuit.]
Natasha Romanoff: I got the two on the left.
[Steve is also running across cars. He spots a vest in the middle of a crowd.]
Steve Rogers: They ditched their gear. It's a shell game now. One of them has the payload.
[Someone throws a bomb at Steve. It sticks on his shield. Steve throws it in the air and the bomb detonates safely away from citizens. Rumlow comes up behind Steve and punches him in the back.]
Brock Rumlow: There you are, you son of a bitch. I’ve been waiting for this!
[Meanwhile, Sam is still chasing the other mercenaries. Sam flies up and takes out his two, then searches their bags for the payload.]
Sam Wilson: He doesn't have it. I’m empty.
[Natasha is chasing the soldiers through the crowd.]
Natasha Romanoff: Out of the way!
[She tackles one soldier and engages him in combat. When the other soldier arrives, she hurls a basket at him to distract him. She uses her skills to fight them and ends up face-to-face with one soldier. They point their guns at each other. A moment passes. Then, the other soldier produces the vial.]
Mercenary #1: Drop it. Or I’ll drop this. Drop it!
Mercenary #2: He'll do it!
[Redwing descends and fires at the soldier with the vial. He drops, and in the moment of distraction, Natasha fires at the other soldier, then catches the falling vial.]
Natasha Romanoff: Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.
Sam Wilson: Don't thank me.
Natasha Romanoff: I’m… not thanking that thing.
Sam Wilson: His name is Redwing.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm still not thanking it.
Sam Wilson: He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.
[Steve and Rumlow are still fighting, neither one seeming to have the upper hand.]
Brock Rumlow: Come on!
[Rumlow pins Steve to a building and extends a blade from one of his gauntlets.]
Brock Rumlow: This is for dropping a building on my face.
[Steve grabs Rumlow's arm and pulls the gauntlet off, only for Rumlow to reveal another knife. But Steve bests him. Defeated, on his knees, Rumlow removes his mask, revealing a scarred face.]
Brock Rumlow: I think I look pretty good, all things considered.
Steve Rogers: Who's your buyer?
Brock Rumlow: You know, he knew you. You pal, your buddy, your Bucky.
Steve Rogers: What did you say?
Brock Rumlow: He remembered you. I was there. He got all weepy about it. Till they put his brain back in a blender. He wanted you to know something. He said to me, "Please tell Rogers. When you gotta go, you gotta go." And you're coming with me.
[He activates his bomb vest and Steve flinches as Rumlow's armor ignites, but Wanda keeps the blast contained around Rumlow who grimaces in agony. She lifts him into the air before she loses control, and the explosion finally blossoms, devastating entire floors of a nearby office building. Wanda sees what happened and covers her mouth in shock.]
Steve Rogers: Oh my . . . [Steve stares up, open mouthed.] Sam . . . We need . . . Fire and Rescue . . . on the south side of the building. We gotta get up there.
[Soft piano is playing. Tony Stark's mother, Maria, sits at a piano. A young Tony is on the couch.]
Maria Stark: Try to remember the kind of September. When grass was green . . . [She stops singing as Howard Stark walks in, but continues playing.] Wake up, dear, and say goodbye to your father.
Howard Stark: Who's the homeless person on the couch?
[Tony, wearing a Santa hat, staggers to his feet and chuckles.]
Young Tony Stark: This is why I love coming home for Christmas . . . right before you leave town.
Maria Stark: Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad.
Howard Stark: Really, which broad? What's her name?
Young Tony Stark: Candice.
[Howard pulls of Tony's hat.]
Howard Stark: Do me a favor? Try not to burn the house down before Monday.
Young Tony Stark: Okay, so it's Monday. That is good to know. I will plan my toga party accordingly. Where you going?
Maria Stark: You father's flying us to the Bahamas for a little getaway.
Howard Stark: We might have to make a quick stop.
Young Tony Stark: At the Pentagon. Right? Don't worry, you're gonna love the holiday menu at the commissary.
[Maria stops playing the piano.]
Howard Stark: You know, they say sarcasm is a metric for potential. If that's true, you'll be a great man some day. I'll get the bags.
[He walks out of the room, and Maria stands up.]
Maria Stark: He does miss you when you are not here. And frankly, you're going to miss us. Because this is the last time we're all going to be together. You know what's about to happen. Say something. If you don't, you'll regret it.
[Howard walks back in.]
Young Tony Stark: I love you, Dad. And I know you did the best you could.
[Maria leans in to kiss Tony on the cheek, and when she leans back, an older Tony Stark is standing in the background. Howard and Maria walk out, leaving the two Tonys.]
Tony Stark: That's how I wished it happened. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus to . . . clear traumatic memories. Huh.
[He blows on a candle and everything around him shimmers, then starts to dissolve. It's a hologram.]
Tony Stark: It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport . . . or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but . . . [He takes off his glasses.] Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment? No one in the right mind would've ever funded it.
[He is standing on a stage in front of a large crowd. A sign reads MIT Alumni Honors: Tony Stark.]
Tony Stark: Help me out, what's the MIT mission statement? "To generate, disseminate . . . and preserve knowledge. And work with others . . . to bring it to bear on the world's great challenges." Well, you are the others. And, quiet as it's kept . . . the challenges facing you are the greatest mankind's ever known. Plus, most of you are broke.
[The crowd chuckles.]
Tony Stark: Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment . . . every student has been made an equal recipient of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant. As in . . . all of your projects have just been approved and funded.
[The crowd breaks out in applause and cheering.]
Tony Stark: No strings, no taxes… just re-frame the future! Starting now.
[The teleprompter above the audience reads. 'Now I would like to introduce the head of the foundation: Pepper Potts.' Tony stares at it sadly.]
Tony Stark: Go break some eggs.
[He exits the stage.]
MIT teacher: Wow. Wow. That uh . . . that took my breathe away. Oh, Tony! So generous. So much money! Wow! Out of curiosity . . . will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty? I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out. I have got this killer idea for a self-cooking hot dog. Basically, chemical detonator embedded . . .
[Tony is not listening.]
Tony Stark: Restroom's this way, yeah?
MIT teacher: Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.
Stark's Assistant: Mr. Stark, I am so sorry about the teleprompter. I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled. They didn't have time to fix it.
Tony Stark: It's . . . fine. I'll be right back.
MIT teacher: We'll catch up later.
[Tony steps into a quiet corridor. He loiters by the men's room, then glances back at the stage door before walking towards the elevator. A woman in sober clothes is also waiting. Tony stops and turns his back to the wall.]
Mrs. Spencer: That was nice, what you did for those young people.
Tony Stark: Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience.
Mrs. Spencer: They say there's a correlation between generosity and guilt. But if you've got the money . . . break as many eggs as you like. Right?
[He narrows his eyes and half smiles, then turns to face the elevator. He looks surprised to find the button unlit and pushes it himself.]
Tony Stark: Are you going up?
Mrs. Spencer: I'm right where I want to be.
[She digs in her handbag, Tony grabs her wrist. He realizes what he's done.]
Tony Stark: Okay, okay. Hey! Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.
Mrs. Spencer: I work for the State Department. Human Resources. I know it's boring . . . but it enabled me to raise a son. I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.
[She shoves a photo at him.]
Mrs Spencer: His name was Charlie Spencer. You murdered him. In Sokovia. Not that it matters in the least to you. You think you fight for us. You just fight for yourself.
[Tony shakes his head.]
Mrs Spencer: Who's going to avenge my son, Stark? He's dead . . . and I blame you.
[She turns and walks away, leaving Tony standing by the elevator with a grim frown.]
[At the Avengers Compound. Steve catches Wanda watching a news report on the Lagos attack and how they blame her for it.]
News Anchor #1: 11 Wakandans were among those killed during a confrontation between the Avengers and a group of mercenaries in Lagos, Nigeria, last month. The traditionally reclusive Wakandans were on an outreach mission in Lagos when the attack occurred.
King T'Chaka: Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil. Not only because of the actions of criminals, but by the indifference of those pledged to stop them. Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all.
News Anchor #1: The Wakanda king went on to . . .
[Steve, who was watching the news, turns his computer off, but sound drifts toward him from another room.]
News anchor #2: They are operating outside and above the international law. Because that's the reality, if we don't respond to acts like these.
[Wanda is sitting on her bed, watching the news on her TV.]
News Anchor #2 What legal authority does an enhanced individual like Wanda Maximoff have to operate in Nigeri -
[The TV turns off. Steve sets the remote down and leans on the door frame.]
Wanda Maximoff: It's my fault.
Steve Rogers: That's not true.
Wanda Maximoff: Turn the TV back on. They're being very specific.
Steve Rogers: I should've clocked that bomb vest long before you had to deal with it.
[He walks over.]
Steve Rogers: Rumlow said "Bucky" and . . . all of a sudden I was a 16-year-old kid again, in Brooklyn. [He sits beside Wanda.]
Steve Rogers: And people died. It's on me.
Wanda Maximoff: It's on both of us.
Steve Rogers: This job . . . we try to save as many people as we can. Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody. But if we can't find a way to live with that, next time . . . maybe nobody gets saved.
[Vision materializes through the wall. Wanda starts.]
[Vision interrupts Wanda and Steve by walking through the wall into Wanda’s room]
Wanda Maximoff: Vis! We talked about this.
Vision: Yes, but the door was open so I assumed that . . .
[He gestures at the door and stops.]
Vision: Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr. Stark was arriving.
Steve Rogers: Thank you. We'll be right down.
Vision: I'll . . . use the door. Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest.
Steve Rogers: We know who it is?
Vision: The Secretary of State.
[The Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross, is standing at the head of a table. Rhodey, Natasha, Steve, Tony, Sam, Vision, and Wanda are gathered around.]
[The Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross has summoned the Avengers to a meeting]
Secretary Ross: Five years ago, I had a heart attack. I dropped right in the middle of my back-swing. Turned out it was the best round of my life, because after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass . . . I found something 40 years in the Army had never taught me: Perspective. The world owes the Avengers an un-payable debt. You have fought for us, protected us, risked your lives . . . but while a great many people see you as heroes, there are some . . . who would prefer the word "vigilantes".
Natasha Romanoff: And what word would you use, Mr. Secretary?
Secretary Ross: How about "dangerous"? What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals who routinely ignore sovereign borders and inflict their will wherever they choose and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind?
[Ross activates a screen behind him. News footage from past Avengers and SHIELD matters flash on the screen as he speaks.]
Secretary Ross: New York.
[A Chitauri leviathan. Terrified citizens. A soldier firing a gun. The Hulk smashes into a building and sends a dust cloud to engulf the camera.]
[Rhodey looks regretful. He glances behind him at Natasha.]
Secretary Ross: Washington DC.
[The three Insight helicarriers, firing on each other. The destroyed Triskelion. A helicarrier crashing into the Potomac and throwing up a massive wave, engulfing citizens and the camera.]
[Sam looks down.]
Secretary Ross: Sokovia.
[Terrified citizens, running. The city rising. A building falling over.]
[Wanda stares at the screen, as does Tony.]
Secretary Ross: Lagos.
[The burning building. Paramedics moving a body. A dead girl.]
[Wanda is particularly affected by the footage from Lagos. Steve sees this and intervenes.]
Steve Rogers: Okay. That's enough.
[Secretary Ross nods to an aide and the images disappear.]
Secretary Ross: For the past four years, you've operated with unlimited power and no supervision. That's an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution. [he places a thick document on the desk and passes it to Wanda]
[An aide hands him a thick book, which Ross slides across the table to Wanda. She picks it up, then slides it to Rhodey.]
Secretary Ross: The Sokovia Accords. Approved by 117 countries . . . it states that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel, only when and if that panel deems it necessary.
Steve Rogers: The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place. I feel we've done that.
Secretary Ross: Tell me, Captain, do you know where Thor and Banner are right now?
[Steve looks up and meets Ross's eyes.]
Secretary Ross: If I misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes . . . you can bet there'd be consequences. Compromise. Reassurance. That's how the world works. Believe me, this is the middle ground.
James Rhodes: So, there are contingencies.
Secretary Ross: Three days from now, the UN meets in Vienna to ratify the Accords.
[Steve glances at Tony.]
Secretary Ross: Talk it over.
Natasha Romanoff: And if we come to a decision you don't like?
Secretary Ross: Then you retire.
[Natasha stifles a smile.]
[Cleveland.]
[Vasily Karpov sits, eating at the table in a cluttered house. He hears the sound of something crashing outside and peers through drawn blinds. Outside, Helmut Zemo stands by his car, the front end crumpled against Karpov's car.]
Helmut Zemo: Hello? Is this your car out front?
[Zemo comes to the door.]
Helmut Zemo: I jumped the curb.
[Karpov eyes his gun nearby.]
Helmut Zemo: Maybe we could take care of it ourselves. If you wanna call the cops, tha--that's okay too, I guess.
Vasily Karpov: No. No cops.
Helmut Zemo: Thank you.
[Karpov slides a heavy duty lock and opens the door. Zemo punches him.]
[Zemo is using a sledgehammer to smash a hole in the wall. He retrieves a large box from inside the hole and tips the contents onto a table. Karpov is hanging upside down, tied to pipes in his basement. There are various documents and the red book with the star on the cover. He holds the red book for a moment then opens a file. Inside is a photo of Karpov in his military uniform and beret.]
Helmut Zemo: You have kept your looks, Colonel. Congratulations.
[Karpov's head is in a sink, which is filling with water.]
Helmut Zemo: "Mission report: December 16, 1991."
Vasily Karpov: Who are you?
Helmut Zemo: My name is Zemo. I will repeat my question. Mission report. December 16, 1991.
Vasily Karpov: How did you find me?
Helmut Zemo: When SHIELD fell, Black Widow released HYDRA files to the public. Millions of pages much of it encrypted, not easy to decipher. But . . . I have experience. And patience. A man can do anything if he has those.
Vasily Karpov: What do you want?
Helmut Zemo: Mission report. December 16. 1991.
Vasily Karpov: Go . . . to . . . hell.
[Zemo goes to lean on the sink as water continues to flow into it. He turns off the tap and studies Karpov's upside down face.]
Helmut Zemo: HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap. So your death would not bother me. But I'd have to use this book . . . and other bloodier methods to find what I need. I don't look forward to that. You'd only be dying for . . . your pride.
[Zemo stares at Karpov then nods resignedly. He turns the tap back on. The water is up to Karpov's eyes. Zemo watches the water level rise.]
Vasily Karpov: Hail HYDRA.
[Holding the red book Zemo walks away. Karpov twitches and struggles in his bindings.]
[The Avengers are gathered at HQ. Steve is sitting, studying the Accords, while Rhodey and Sam argue behind him.]
James Rhodes: Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal of Honor, which is one more than you have.
Sam Wilson: So let's say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?
James Rhodes: A 117 countries want to sign this. 117, Sam, and you're just like, "No, that's cool. We got it. "
Sam Wilson: How long are you going to play both sides?
Vision: I have an equation.
Sam Wilson: Oh, this will clear it up.
Vision: In the eight years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate.
Steve Rogers: Are you saying it's our fault?
Vision: I'm saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict . . . breeds catastrophe. Oversight . . . oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.
James Rhodes: Boom.
[Tony is lying on the couch, one hand over his face. When Natasha speaks, he removes the hand to look at her.]
Natasha Romanoff: Tony. You are being uncharacteristically non-hyper-verbal.
Steve Rogers: It's because he's already made up his mind.
Tony Stark: Boy, you know me so well.
[He gets up and winces, rubbing the back of his head.]
Tony Stark: Actually, I'm nursing an electromagnetic headache.
[He walks to the kitchen and grabs a mug.]
Tony Stark: That's what's going on, Cap. It's just pain. It's discomfort. Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?
[He puts his phone in a basket and taps it.The phone projects an image of a smiling young man. He looks down, then back up, and pretends to notice the picture for the first time.]
Tony Stark: Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid. Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA. Had a floor level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul, before he parked it behind a desk. See the world. Maybe be of service. Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where, Sokovia.
[The others look affected by this .]
Tony Stark: He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass. [He takes a pill with some coffee, then faces the others.]
Tony Stark: There's no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary-less, we're no better than the bad guys.
Steve Rogers: Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don't give up.
Tony Stark: Who said we're giving up?
Steve Rogers: We are if we're not taking responsibility for our actions. This document just shifts the blames.
James Rhodes: I'm sorry. Steve. That - that is dangerously arrogant. This is the United Nations we're talking about. It's not the World Security Council, it's not SHIELD, it's not HYDRA.
Steve Rogers: No, but it's run by people with agendas, and agendas change.
Tony Stark: That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing.
Steve Rogers: Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.
Tony Stark: If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty.
Wanda Maximoff: You're saying they'll come for me.
Vision: We would protect you.
Natasha Romanoff: Maybe Tony's right.
[Tony looks at her, surprised.]
Natasha Romanoff: If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off -
Sam Wilson: Aren't you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago?
Natasha Romanoff: I'm just . . . I'm reading the terrain. We have made . . . some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back.
Tony Stark: Focus up. I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me?
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, I want to take it back now.
Tony Stark: No, no, no. You can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay, case closed--I win.
[Steve's phone buzzes, and he pulls it out to check it. A text message reads: 'She's gone. In her sleep.']
Steve Rogers: I have to go.
[Steve gets up sharply, drops the Accords on the coffee table, and goes downstairs. He stops at the bottom of the stairs, leans against the banister, and bows his head.]
[London.]
[A cathedral, packed with mourners. A choir is singing. Steve is one of six pallbearers carrying a coffin draped with the Union Jack. His eyes are red--he's been crying.]
[At the altar, a candle burns by a framed photograph of Peggy Carter in a military uniform. The label reads "Margaret 'Peggy' Carter". The priest addresses the mourners.]
Priest: And now, I would like to invite Sharon Carter to come up and say a few words.
[Agent 13, Steve's "neighbor" from DC, steps up to the podium.]
[Steve sits beside Sam in a pew at the front. Steve is looking down and doesn't see Sharon walk up. Sam is watching, and nudges Steve. He looks up to see Sharon, who glances at Steve and takes a breath.]
Sharon Carter: Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of SHIELD . . . but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.
[Steve realizes who exactly Sharon is, and takes a surprised breath.]
Sharon Carter: She had a photograph in her office. Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK. As a kid, that was pretty cool. But it was a lot to live up to. Which is why I never told anyone we were related.
[She looks directly at Steve.]
Sharon Carter: I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. And she said, compromise where you can. But where you can't, don't. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move . . . it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in they eye and say " No, you move."
[Later, Steve stands alone in the isle, still dressed in black. Natasha to him and he turns to her. He begins to speak without any introduction]
Steve Rogers: When I came out of the ice, I thought everyone I had known was gone. Then I found out that she was alive. I was just lucky to have her.
Natasha Romanoff: She had you back, too.
Steve Rogers: Who else signed?
Natasha Romanoff: Tony. Rhodey. Vision.
Steve Rogers: Clint?
Natasha Romanoff: Says he's retired.
[She smiles slightly.]
Steve Rogers: Wanda?
Natasha Romanoff: TBD (To Be Determined). I'm off to Vienna for the signing of the Accords. There's plenty of room on the jet.
[Steve sighs and bows his head.]
Natasha Romanoff: Just because it's the path of least resistance doesn't mean it's the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together.
[Natasha almost seems to be convincing herself.]
Steve Rogers: What are we giving up to do it?
[She sighs. He shakes his head, unconvinced.]
Steve Rogers: I'm sorry, Nat. I can't sign it.
Natasha Romanoff: I know.
Steve Rogers: Then what are you doing here?
Natasha Romanoff: I didn't want you to be alone.
[She pulls him in for a hug.]
Natasha Romanoff: Come here.
[Vienna.]
[The United Nations, a modern complex of interestingly-shaped high rise buildings.]
News Anchor #3: At a special United Nations conference 117 countries have come together to ratify the Sokovia Accords.
[T'Challa wears a sharp suit and stands, looking through a glass wall.]
UN staffer: Excuse me, Miss Romanoff?
Natasha Romanoff: Yes?
UN staffer: These need your signature. [T'Challa looks over at Natasha.] Thank you.
Natasha Romanoff: Thanks.
T'Challa: I suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight.
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.
T'Challa: You seem to be doing alright so far. Considering your last trip to Capitol Hill . . . I wouldn't think you would be particularly comfortable in this company.
Natasha Romanoff: Well, I'm not.
T'Challa: That alone makes me glad you're here, Miss Romanoff.
Natasha Romanoff: Why? You don't approve of all this?
T'Challa: The Accords, yes. The politics, not really. Two people in a room can get more done than a hundred.
King T'Chaka: Unless you need to move a piano.
T'Challa: Father.
King T'Chaka: Son. Miss Romanoff.
Natasha Romanoff: King T'Chaka. Please, allow me to apologize for what happened in Nigeria.
King T'Chaka: Thank you. Thank you for agreeing to all this. I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers will not be joining us today.
Natasha Romanoff: Yes, so am I.
Man on speakers: If everyone could please be seated. This assembly is now in session.
T'Challa: That is the future calling. Such a pleasure.
Natasha Romanoff: Thank you. [Natasha goes.]
King T'Chaka: For a man who disapproves of diplomacy, you're getting quite good at it.
T'Challa: I'm happy, Father.
King T'Chaka: Thank you.
T'Challa: Thank you.
King T'Chaka: When stolen Wakandan vibranium was used to make a terrible weapon, we in Wakanda were forced to question our legacy. Those men and women killed in Nigeria, were part of a goodwill mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, let misfortune drive us back. We will fight to improve the world we wish to join. I am grateful to the Avengers for supporting this initiative. [T'Challa spots something outside.] Wakanda is proud to extend its hand in peace.
T'Challa: EVERYBODY GET DOWN!
[An enormous explosion goes off between two buildings and destroys the conference hall. T'Challa finds his father lying on the floor with his eyes closed. He grabs his father's wrist and feels for a pulse, but his father lies still. Devastated T'Challa lies across his father. He lifts him up and rocks him in his arms.]
[A hotel.]
Sharon Carter: My mom tried to talk me out of enlisting, but, um, not Aunt Peggy. She bought me my first thigh holster.
Steve Rogers: Very practical.
Sharon Carter: And stylish. [Sharon and Steve wait by an elevator. They stand facing each other.]
Steve Rogers: CIA has you stationed over here now?
Sharon Carter: In Berlin, Joint Terrorism Task Force.
Steve Rogers: Right. Right. Sounds fun.
Sharon Carter: I know, right?
Steve Rogers: [Steve nods and smiles at Sharon.] I've been meaning to ask you. When you were spying on me from across the hall . . . .
Sharon Carter: You mean when I was doing my job.
Steve Rogers: Did Peggy know?
Sharon Carter: She kept so many secrets. I didn't want her to have one from you. [The elevator arrives.] Thanks for walking me back.
Steve Rogers: Sure. [Sam comes over.]
Sam Wilson: Steve. There's something you gotta see.
News anchor #4: A bomb hidden in a news van . . .
Sharon Carter: Who's coordinating?
News anchor #4: . . . ripped through the UN building in Vienna.
Sharon Carter: Good. They're solid. Forensics?
News anchor #4: More than 70 people have been injured. At least 12 are dead, including Wakanda's King T'Chaka. Officials have released a video of a suspect who they have identified as James Buchanan Barnes, the Winter Soldier. The infamous HYDRA agent, linked to numerous acts of terrorism and political assassinations.
Sharon Carter: I have to go to work.
[Fire crews hose down the buildings. A red and white medical chopper flies overhead.]
Sharon Carter: Call MI-6, see if we can get Micro Forensics to hurry this up. We need the whole team here in two hours or it's not worth it. [Sharon strides through with a man in a green jumpsuit. They pass T'Challa who sits on a bench looking stunned. There's a cut on his head. Natasha sits on the next bench along.]
Natasha Romanoff: I'm very sorry.
T'Challa: [He glances at her. He's holding an ornate silver ring which he toys with between his fingers.] In my culture death is not the end. It's more of a . . . stepping-off point. You reach out with both hands and Bast and Sekhmet, they lead you into the green veldt where . . . you can run forever.
Natasha Romanoff: That sounds very peaceful.
T'Challa: My father thought so. [He puts the ring on his finger.] I am not my father.
Natasha Romanoff: T'Challa. Task force will decide who brings in Barnes.
T'Challa: [He clenches his fist.] Don't bother, Miss Romanoff. I'll kill him myself. [He walks away.]
[Steve phones Natasha. He's standing on the street in a cap and dark glasses.]
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah?
Steve Rogers: You alright?
Natasha Romanoff: Ah, yeah, thanks. I got lucky. [Frowning she looks around, then stands up.] I know how much Barnes means to you. I really do. Stay home. You'll only make this worse. For all of us. Please.
Steve Rogers: Are you saying you'll arrest me?
Natasha Romanoff: No. Someone will. If you interfere. That's how it works now.
Steve Rogers: If he's this far gone, Nat, I should be the one to bring him in.
Natasha Romanoff: Why?
Steve Rogers: Because I'm the one least likely to die trying. [Not far away Steve ends the call.]
Natasha Romanoff: Shit.
[Steve approaches Sam sitting at the counter of a coffee shop.]
Sam Wilson: She tell you to stay out of it? [He's also in a cap and shades.] Might have a point.
Steve Rogers: He'd do it for me.
Sam Wilson: 1945, maybe. I just want to make sure we considered all our options. The people that shoot at you usually wind up shooting at me. [Sharon arrives by Steve.]
Sharon Carter: Tips have been pouring in since that footage went public. Everybody thinks the Winter soldier goes to their gym. Most of it's noise. Except for this. [She slides Steve a file.] My boss expects a briefing, pretty much now . . . so that's all the head start you're gonna get.
Steve Rogers: Thank you.
Sharon Carter: And you're gonna have to hurry. We have orders to shoot on sight.
[Zemo sits in a hotel room. He reads from Karpov's red book.]
Helmut Zemo: Возвращение на Родину. Возвращение на Родину. Один. Один. Грузовой вагон… Грузовой вагон. Грузов- ([subtitled] Homecoming. One. One. Fright Car.) [Knocking at the door. He puts the book in a drawer and goes to the door. He reaches for a gun tucked in the back of his trouser and cocks it.]
German Innkeeper: Herr Müller, ich habe Ihr Frühstück. ([subtitled] Mr. Müller. I have your breakfast.) [Zemo opens the door.]
Helmut Zemo: Ich konnte es schon von weitem riechen. Danke. ([subtitled] I could smell it before I opened the door. Thank you.)
German Innkeeper: Speck und schwarzer Kaffe. Wieder. Ich kann Ihnen auch was anderes machen, wenn Sie das möchten. ([subtitled] Side of bacon and black coffee. Again. I can make you something different, if you like.)
Helmut Zemo: Bitte sehr, das ist wunderbar. ([subtitled] It's okay. This is wonderful.)
German Innkeeper: Ich stell es dann mal hier hin… ([subtitled] I'll put this on your . . .)
Helmut Zemo: Nein, nein. Das geht schon. Ich mach das. Vielen Dank, Frau Leiber. ([subtitled] No, no. It's okay. I can manage. Thank you Mrs. Leiber.) [Zemo closes the door. In the room is a large device with a cage at the bottom and a drum of coppered wire on top.]
[Bucharest. Bucky is in civvies at a fruit store. He buys some plums!]
Bucky Barnes: [talking to the vendor in Romanian] ([assumed translation] How are they? Are they good? Give me six, thank you.[2])
[In a black cap and casual jacket Bucky walks along scanning around. Across the street he spots a twenty-something vender at a news-stand watching him. Bucky glances away, then looks back at the vender who's still watching him. The vender runs from his kiosk. Bucky goes over and picks up a paper. On the front page there are surveillance-photos of a man and the head line: 'Winter Soldier cautat pentru Bombardmentul din Viena'. Bucky glances around tensely.]
[In his dark blue, armored suit with his shield on his arm Steve is in a small apartment. He looks around, there's a mattress with disheveled covers and various bits of cheap looking furniture. The kitchen and bedroom are in the same room. Steve finds a notebook on top of the fridge. He picks it up and opens it. There are tabs of varying colors sticking out from amongst the pages.]
Sam Wilson: [on radio] Heads up, Cap. German Special Forces, approaching from the south.
Steve Rogers: Understood. [Bucky's standing behind Steve. Steve slowly turns around to face him.] Do you know me?
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky stares at him.] You're Steve. I read about you in a museum.
Sam Wilson: They've set the perimeter.
Steve Rogers: I know you're nervous. And you have plenty of reason to be. But you're lying.
Bucky Barnes: I wasn't in Vienna. I don't do that anymore.
Sam Wilson: They're entering the building.
Steve Rogers: Well, the people who think you did are coming here now. And they're not planning on taking you alive.
Bucky Barnes: That's smart. Good strategy.
Sam Wilson: They're on the roof. I'm compromised.
[Armed cops run upstairs.]
Steve Rogers: This doesn't have end in a fight, Buck.
[Outside the door a cop readies a battering ram.]
Bucky Barnes: It always ends in a fight.
Sam Wilson: 5 seconds.
Steve Rogers: You pulled me from the river. Why?
Bucky Barnes: I don't know.
Sam Wilson: 3 seconds!
Steve Rogers: Yes, you do.
Sam Wilson: Breach! Breach! Breach! [A grenade crashes through the window. Bucky kicks it to Steve, and he smothers it with his shield.]
GSG-9 Soldier: Schieß die Tür auf! (Shoot the door!) [The cop slams the battering ram against the door. Bucky shields himself with the mattress against an attack from the window. He blocks the door with a table as cops swing in on cables. Steve pulls the rug from under a policeman, sending him flying. Bucky slams another policeman into the wall.]
Steve Rogers: Buck, stop! You're gonna kill someone.
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky slams Steve down and punches a hole in the floor.] I'm not gonna kill anyone.
[Bucky grabs a backpack from under the floorboards and throws it out of the window. Bucky and Steve get behind Steve's shield to avoid gunfire. Bucky shoves Steve and he knocks a cop over. Bucky holds up his metal hand and repells bullets, then slams a cop into shelves. Bucky picks up a large cement brick and slams it into a cop. Steve fights a cop on the balcony. A cop shoots around the door outside. Bucky punches through the wall beside he door. He lays into the cops. A cop descends through a sky-light on a zip wire. Bucky grabs the cop's gun and slams him into the wall. Bucky bashes a couple of cops with the battering ram. More of the police team hurry up the stairwell. Bucky jumps on the zip-line-guy and swings down a level.]
GSG-9 Soldier: Der Verdächtige ist ausgebrochen. Er ist am östlichen Treppenschacht. ([subtitled] Suspect has broken containment! He's headed down the east stairwell!)
[Steve grabs the radio and crushes it. Steve jumps down a level as Bucky keeps punching the cops. Bucky tosses one of them over the railing and Steve catches him, stopping the cop from falling. He looks at Bucky wearily.]
Steve Rogers: Come on, man.
[Steve throws the cop up onto the landing. Bucky breaks a banister and swings down on it. Steve hurls a cop over his shoulders. Bucky lays into jet more cops and takes them out. A cop aims at Bucky and Steve knocks the gun from his hands with his shield which sticks in the wall. Bucky leaps down the stairwell and catches onto a railing. Steve pulls his shiel out of the wall. Bucky climbs up then runs along a corridor and leaps off a balcony. He tumbles onto the lower roof of the neighboring building where he finds where his backpack. he picks it up and runs.]
[A muscular man clad entirely in black, Black Panther, slams into Bucky from behind, knocking him down. He has a full face mask with pointed ears. He extends his fingers and sharp claws pop out. He attacks Bucky with sweeping kicks and slashes. Bucky fights back but is kicked into a wall. Black Panther swipes his claws and spins gracefully. Bucky narrowly avoids being slashed, he holds up a metal bar to protect himself.]
[Steve looks down at them as Falcon swoops from the sky.]
Steve Rogers: Sam, southwest rooftop.
Sam Wilson: Who the hell's the other guy?
Steve Rogers: About to find out.
[Steve leaps from the balcony down onto the neighboring building as a chopper flies up. Black Panther lunges at Bucky with his claws, but Bucky grabs his wrists. A soldier fires a machine gun from the chopper. The ammo bounces off Black Panther's armored suit.]
Steve Rogers: Sam.
Sam Wilson: Got him. [Sam flies down and shoves the chopper off course. Then swoops towards street level.]
[Bucky breaks free from his attacker, slings his bag on his back, runs and jumps down a level. Black Panther slides down the wall using his claws for traction. Back lands at street level and the chase continues. Steve follows and lands rolling along the ground. Gunfire from the chopper tears up the sidewalk. Bucky jumps down through an opening and lands in an underpass, he runs through the traffic. Black Panther and Captain America drop down and chase after Bucky. A Special Forces Vehicle pursues them.]
GSG-9 Driver: Stand down! Stand down! [The vehicle closes in, blue lights flashing. Steve leaps onto the vehicle and splinters the windshield. The driver stops, Steve yanks him from the vehicle and kicks the windshield out, then drives off.]
[Bucky runs over the top of a speeding car, outpacing it. Black Panther is a few cars behind, keeping pace with Bucky. he leaps on the back of the 4x4 that Steve's driving. Steve swerves from side to side, trying to throw him off.]
Steve Rogers: Sam, I can't shake this guy.
Sam Wilson: Right behind you.
[Several police cars join the chase. Steve side-swipes another car and drives on.]
[Up ahead Bucky reaches a fork in the road and faces oncoming traffic. He leaps over a barrier. Steve drives through the barrier.]
[A motorbike speeds towards Bucky. Bucky grabs the handlebar and spins the bike around in mid air, throwing the rider off. Bcuky gets on the bike and rides away sending cars careering out of the way. Steve keeps on Bucky's tail with Black Panther holding onto the back of the 4x4. They all rocket through another underpass. Sam flies into the underpass. Black Panther leaps off the front of the 4x4 onto Bucky's motorbike. Bucky flings him over his head and the bike leans down on its side. Bucky kicks his assailant away, straightens up and rides on. Black Panther catches a ride on Falcon's leg. Sam tries to kick Black Panther away. Bucky throws a sticky bomb and blows up the roof at the end of the underpass, bringing down tons of rubble. Black Panther leaps off from Falcon and throws Bucky off the motorbike. Steve swerves the 4x4 through the rubble, leaps out and pulls Black Panther away from Bucky. Steve stands, facing sleek and muscular Black Panther. Armed police arrive and surround them, guns aimed. War Machine leaps down from above and raises both hands.]
James Rhodes: Stand down, now. [Bucky stands beside Steve who puts his shield on his back.] Congratulations, Cap. You're a criminal. [Police move in and force Bucky to his knees. Black Panther raises his hands. A cop moves Steve's arms behind his back. Black Panther retracts his claws and pulls off his mask revealing his face. It's T'Challa. Steve and Rhodes look curious.]
GSG-9 Soldier: Wie lautet der Befehl? (What's the order?)
James Rhodes: Your highness. [Bucky's hauled flat on the ground.]
[Avengers HQ. Vision follows a recipe.]
Vision: 'A pinch of paprika.' A pinch. [He adds a pinch. Wanda strolls in.]
Wanda Maximoff: Is that paprikash?
Vision: I thought it might . . . lift your spirits.
Wanda Maximoff: [She chuckles, stirs the ingredients in the pan with a spoon. She lifts the spoon to her lips, blows and has a taste. She smiles.] Spirits lifted.
Vision: In my defense, I haven't actually ever . . . eaten anything before, so . . .
Wanda Maximoff: May I?
Vision: Please. Wanda?
Wanda Maximoff: Hmm.
Vision: No one dislikes you, Wanda. [She frowns curiously.]
Wanda Maximoff: Thanks.
Vision: Oh, you're welcome. No, it's a . . . involuntary response in their amygdala. They can't help but be afraid of you.
Wanda Maximoff: Are you?
Vision: My amygdala is synthetic, so . . . [Wanda laughs.]
Wanda Maximoff: I used to think of myself one way. But after this . . . [her fingers glow.] I am something else. I'm still me, I think, but . . . that's not what everyone else sees.
Vision: [He touches the mind stone in his forehead.] Do you know, I don't know what this is? [It glows.] Not really. I know it's not of this world, that it powered Loki's staff, gave you your abilities, but . . . its true nature is a mystery. And yet, it is part of me.
Wanda Maximoff: Are you afraid of it?
Vision: I wish to understand it. The more I do, the less it controls me. One day . . . who knows? I may even control it.
Wanda Maximoff: [Wanda looks at the food.] I don't know what's in this but it is not paprika. I'm gonna go to the store. I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Vision: Alternatively, we could order a pizza?
Wanda Maximoff: Vision, are you not letting me leave?
Vision: [He blocks her way.] It is a question of safety.
Wanda Maximoff: I can protect myself.
Vision: [He holds her arm.] Not yours. Mr. Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on a . . . more secured foundation.
Wanda Maximoff: And what do you want?
Vision: For people to see you . . . as I do. [She looks at him gravely.]
[Berlin, day. Traffic rolls around the victory column. Police convoy drives beside the river Spree. Amidst the convoy is a gray armed truck. Inside Bucky wears restraints inside a prison pod. Three armed guards sit on the other side of the glass-walled pod. A police motorbike stops traffic and a van driver looks affronted. The convoy turns a corner onto a bridge across the river. In an SUV T'Challa sits in front of Steve who sits in front of Sam.]
Sam Wilson: So, you like cats?
Steve Rogers: Sam.
Sam Wilson: What? Dude shows up dressed like a cat and you don't wanna know more?
Steve Rogers: Your suit . . . t's Vibranium?
T'Challa: [T'Challes eyes narrow as he glances sideways.] The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations. A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior. And now, because your friend murdered my father, I also wear the mantle of king. So, I ask you . . . as both warrior and king . . . how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me? [Steve is stony faced as the convoy heads underground.]
[In a light gray walled bunker Bucky's pod is carried away by a forklift. Nearby Steve gets out of the SUV and glances across at Bucky who doesn't spot him. With Sam and T'Challa Steve approaches Sharon who's standing with a diminutive, gray-head man.]
Steve Rogers: What's gonna happen to him?
Everett Ross: Same thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition.
Sharon Carter: This is Everett Ross, Deputy Task Force Commander.
Steve Rogers: What about our lawyer?
Everett Ross: Lawyer. That's funny. See their weapons are placed in lockup. Oh, we'll write you a receipt.
Sam Wilson: I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that. [As they go Steve looks back and catches Bucky's eye.]
[On a covered sky walk.]
Everett Ross: You'll be provided with an office instead of a cell. Now, do me a favor, stay in it?
T'Challa: I don't intend on going anywhere.
Natasha Romanoff: For the record, this is what making things worse looks like.
Steve Rogers: He's alive.
Tony Stark: [on his phone] No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.
Natasha Romanoff: Try not to break anything while we fix this.
Tony Stark: [still on the phone.] Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir.
Steve Rogers: 'Consequences'?
Tony Stark: Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.
Steve Rogers: I'm not getting that shield back, am I?
Natasha Romanoff: Technically, it's the government's property. Wings, too.
Sam Wilson: That's cold.
Tony Stark: Warmer than jail.
[At a power station surrounded by trees the van with the driver who was affronted by the police convoy pulls up by the open gate. Scowling he puts the parking break on and picks up a clip board.]
Delivery Truck Driver: Das kann nicht richtig sein. Was zum Teufel? (This can't be right. What the hell?)
[In a secured chamber a guard connects a pipe to Bucky's prison pod. The lights inside dim for a moment.]
[Tony finds Steve in a glass-walled office overlooking the control room.]
Tony Stark: Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely. [Tony shows him two pens in a black presentation box.] FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most.
Steve Rogers: Some would say it brought our country closer to war.
Tony Stark: See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to . . . what do you call it? That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?
Steve Rogers: Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.
Tony Stark: We're kinda . . . well, not kinda . . .
Steve Rogers: Pregnant?
Tony Stark: No. Definitely not. We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.
Steve Rogers: I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.
Tony Stark: A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA . . . and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don't wanna stop. I don't wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference. [Tony stands up and paces.] In her defense, I'm a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work.
Steve Rogers: You know, I'm glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single.
Tony Stark: Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you.
Steve Rogers: I don't mean to make things difficult.
Tony Stark: I know, because you're a very polite person.
Steve Rogers: If I see a situation pointed south . . . I can't ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could.
Tony Stark: No, you don't.
Steve Rogers: [Steve smiles thinly.] No, I don't. Sometimes . . .
Tony Stark: Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center . . . instead of a Wakandan prison.
Steve Rogers: [Steve frowns thoughtfully and picks up one of the fountain pens. He stands up and paces, then turns to Tony. In the control room beyond there are multiple screens on the walls.] I'm not saying it's impossible, but there would have to be safeguards.
Tony Stark: Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated . . .
Steve Rogers: Wanda? What about Wanda?
Tony Stark: She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company.
Steve Rogers: Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you see things the right way . . .
Tony Stark: What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.
Steve Rogers: Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It's internment, Tony.
Tony Stark: She's not a US citizen.
Steve Rogers: Oh, come on, Tony.
Tony Stark: And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.
Steve Rogers: She's a kid!
Tony Stark: GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done . . . to stave off something worse.
Steve Rogers: [Steve nods faintly.] You keep telling yourself that. [He puts the pen down.] Hate to break up the set. [He leaves the office and rueful Tony watches Bucky on one of the control room's screens.]
Helmut Zemo: [The evaluator sits at a desk facing Bucky's pod. Inside Bucky's still restrained.] Hello, Mr. Barnes. I've been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? Your first name is James?
Sharon Carter: [In an office with Sam and Steve.] The receipt for your gear.
Sam Wilson: 'Bird costume'? Come on.
Sharon Carter: I didn't write it. [Sharon pushes a button witch stops the restriction on the audio from Bucky's evaluation.]
Helmut Zemo: I'm not here to judge you. I just want to ask you a few questions. Do you know where you are, James? I can't help you if you don't talk to me, James.
Bucky Barnes: My name is Bucky.
[At the power station. The van driver honks and looks impatient watching the custodian's hut's front door.]
Delivery Truck Driver: Hallo? ([subtitled] Hello?) [The custodian comes outside and the driver comes out of his van.] Hey. Ich hab eine große für dich. ([subtitled] Hey. I have a big one for you.) [He opens the van's back doors and removes a large wooden crate.] Ja. Okay, hier unterzeichnen. (Okay. Here. Just sign here.)
Custodian: Hier? (Here?)
Delivery Truck Driver: Ja. (Yeah.) [The custodian signs for the crate.]
[At the UN-bunker Steve studies the blurry photograph of the man who bombed the congress in Vienna.]
Steve Rogers: Why would the Task Force release this photo to begin with?
Sharon Carter: Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can?
Steve Rogers: Right. It's a good way to flush a guy out of hiding. Set off a bomb, get your picture taken. Get seven billion people looking for the Winter Soldier.
Sharon Carter: You're saying someone framed him to find him.
Sam Wilson: Steve, we looked for the guy for two years and found nothing.
Steve Rogers: We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.
Sharon Carter: Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would. [Sharon's gaze falls on the evaluator in the screen, her eyes narrow.]
Steve Rogers: [Steve frowns and looks around.] Yeah.
Helmut Zemo: [In the secure chamber.] Tell me, Bucky. You've seen a great deal, haven't you?
Bucky Barnes: I don't want to talk about it.
Helmut Zemo: You fear that… if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. Don't worry. [Zemo gets a message on his screen: 'message inbox:1' touches it 'status: package delivered'.] We only have to talk about one.
[At the power station the custodian opens the crate. Finding Zemo's large device inside, he looks confused. The driver is at the back door of his van.]
Custodian: Hey, was ist das? (Hey. What is this?)
Delivery Truck Driver: Ich weiß es nicht. (I don't know.)
[The device erupts. A bubble of energy engulfs the power station and sparks fly. In the city traffic lights fail. In the bunker the lights go out.]
Everett Ross: Great. Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes. Go.
Tony Stark: FRIDAY, get me the source of that outage.
Sharon Carter: [In the office.] Sub-level 5, east wing. [T'Challa spots Steve and Sam bolting.]
[In Bucky's pod.]
Bucky Barnes: What the hell is this?
Helmut Zemo: Why don't we discuss your home? Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no. I mean, your real home. [Zemo removes his glasses then walks towards Bucky reading from the red book by torchlight.] Желание. ([subtitled] Longing.)
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky shuts his eyes.] No. [Bucky's head snaps back.]
Helmut Zemo: Ржавый. ([subtitled] Rusted.)
Bucky Barnes: Stop.
Helmut Zemo: Семнадцать. ([subtitled] Seventeen.)
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky's metal arm trembles in its restraint.] Stop. [He sneers angrily.]
Helmut Zemo: Рассвет. ([subtitled] Daybreak.)
[Bucky screams, clenches his fist and rips free of his restraints.]
Helmut Zemo: Печь. ([subtitled] Furnace.) Девять. ([subtitled] Nine.)
[Bucky thumps the inside of the pod.]
Helmut Zemo: Добросердечный. ([subtitled] Benign.)
[Bucky punches harder.]
Helmut Zemo: Возвращение на Родину. ([subtitled] Homecoming.) Один. ([subtitled:] One.) Грузовой вагон. ([subtitled] Freight car.)
[Bucky batteres the front of the pod with his metal fist and the glass screen flies clear. Zemo slowly rounds the pod with the book and the torch in hand. he stands before Bucky who straightens, a dark frown on his face.]
Helmut Zemo: Солдат? ([subtitled] Soldier?)
Bucky Barnes: Я готов отвечать. ([subtitled] Ready to comply.)
Helmut Zemo: Mission report. December 16, 1991.
[Steve and Sam arrive outside the chamber. Red emergency lights flash all around. There are many agents slumped on the floor. All of them out cold.]
Helmut Zemo: Help me. Help.
Steve Rogers: [Steve finds Zemo in a heap inside the chamber.] Get up. [he grabs Zemo and shoves him against the wall.] Who are you? What do you want?
Helmut Zemo: To see an empire fall.
[As Sam enters Bucky swings his fist which smashes through the wall as Sam ducks. Bucky grabs him by the jaw and throws him at the open pod. Steve lurches into the fight and lands a punch which Bucky barely feels. Bucky kicks and punches Steve out of the chamber. A punch from Bucky goes through the elevator door. Steve blocks the next one but the power of Bucky's fist sends Steve tumbling into the darkened elevator shaft.]
[In the chamber Sam comes around and spots Zemo looking down the elevator shaft.]
Man on PA #1: Der Ostflügel ist kompromittiert. Ich wiederhole: Der Ostflügel ist kompromittiert. (The east wing is compromised. I repeat: the east wing is compromised.)
Sam Wilson: Hey.
[Zemo bolts, Sam rises. At the bottom of the shaft Steve pushes himself off the floor.]
[In the control room.]
Everett Ross: Evac all civilians. Get me a perimeter around the building, and gunships in the air.
Natasha Romanoff: Please tell me you brought a suit.
Tony Stark: Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. I'm an active-duty non-combatant.
Sharon Carter: Follow me. [Sharon runs past Tony and Natasha.]
[Sam chases Zemo up a stair well.]
[Steve starts to climb the elevator shaft.]
[Bucky stalks through the building's ground floor. He batters two guards. With tech-glasses on Tony takes cover behind a pillar.]
Natasha Romanoff: [on radio:] We're in position.
[Tony taps a wrist-control which becomes his Iron Man-glove. He zaps Bucky with a stun-burst before Bucky can shoot a guard. Tony rushes him, firing again. Bucky ducks the blast then trades blows with Tony, firing the gun. Tony has the Iron Man-glove over the barrel, blocking the bullet. He pulls the gun barrel loose then Bucky smacks him backwards. Sharon rushes Bucky, then Natasha rushes Bucky. They both land kicks and punches, then Bucky flips Sharon head over heels. She smashes onto a table then Natasha leaps on Bucky, legs around his neck. He slams her onto another table and grabs her throat.]
Natasha Romanoff: You could at least recognize me.
[T'Challa comes from nowhere and kicks Bucky off Natasha. He fights with Bucky, landing lightning fast kicks and some punches. Bucky gets a counter punch in and T'Challa falls, but quickly recovers. Bucky hurries up some stairs. T'Challa leaps the levels and vaults a railing, landing in front of Bucky. Limber T'Challa spin-kicks and grabs Bucky's metal arm which he tries to twist then looks worried as he realizes it isn't going to work. He throws Bucky backwards and keeps hold as they both tumble down the stairs. They resume fighting on the small landing and a leg sweep sends Bucky over the railing. T'Challa leaps down after him but finds the wide reception empty. He scans around.]
[Outside staff flee the building en masse. Sam is among them and quickly spots something on the ground. He picks it up.]
Sam Wilson: Damn it. [he looks around the wide courtyard and scowls.]
[Bucky's on the rooftop helipad. He marches up to a blue chopper and pulls the lock off the door. he gets in the pilot seat. Steve rushes outside and sprints toward the rising chopper. He leaps and grabs the landing gear. Muscles bulging Steve pulls hard and the chopper struggles to gain height. Steve's feet kick for traction then he gets them flat on the helipad. The chopper drags him onto the weak looking mesh framing the helipad. Steve grabs the railing with one hand and clings to the landing gear with the other. He grits his teeth and his neck strains with the incredible effort. Bucky glowers from inside the chopper then throws the joystick left and the chopper's nose slams into the edge of the helipad. The rotor-blades are smashed to pieces and Steve ducks as the tail swings around. The chopper lies twisted on the mesh at the edge of the pad. Steve rises beside the canopy. Bucky's arm smashes through the glass and growling he grabs Steve's throat. The chopper starts to list over the edge. The tail breaks off and falls into the river below. Bucky keeps hold of Steve as the whole vehicle drops and slams into the river. The impact seems to knock Bucky out cold and he lets go of Steve. The body of the chopper sinks quickly to the riverbed along with other debris. Steve surfaces with Bucky in his arms.]
[At an airport Zemo listens to a phone message.:]
Zemo's Wife: He asked me again if you were going to be there. I said I wasn't sure. You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.
[Frowning Zemo ends the call. A TV news report is playing nearby:]
News anchor #5: James Barnes, der mit dem Bombenanschlag auf die UN in Wien in Verbindung gebracht wird, ist heute aus der Haft entflohen. Ebenfalls vermisst werden die Avengers Captain Steve Rogers und Sam Wilson. ([subtitled:] James Barnes, the suspect in the UN Vienna bombing escaped custody today. Also missing Avenger Captain Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson.)
[Zemo eyes the TV screen. He stands in line at a departures gate. The screen above the gate reads: 'Gate 06 | Berlin Flughafen | AEM2103 | 14:10 | Moskau/Moscow']
[In a huge abandoned warehouse Bucky comes to with his metallic left arm clamped in a huge industrial vice. Steve peers through a gap at a chopper flying overhead. Sam's over by Bucky.]
Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap! [Steve goes over to join Sam by Bucky who sits with his arm in the vice. They stare at him.]
Bucky Barnes: Steve.
Steve Rogers: Which Bucky am I talking to?
Bucky Barnes: Your mom's name was Sarah...You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.
Steve Rogers: Can't read that in a museum.
Sam Wilson: Just like that, we're suppose to be cool?
Bucky Barnes: What did I do?
Steve Rogers: Enough.
Bucky Barnes: Oh, God, I knew this would happen. Everything HYDRA put inside me is still there. All he had to do was say the goddamn words.
Steve Rogers: Who was he?
Bucky Barnes: I don't know.
Steve Rogers: People are dead. The bombing, the setup. The doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you. I need you to do better than "I don't know."
Bucky Barnes: He wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. He wanted to know exactly where.
Steve Rogers: Why would he need to know that?
Bucky Barnes: Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.
[1991, at night Bucky rides alongside the car and somehow causes the car to crash. He circles back, pulls up and climbs off the motorbike. he's filmed on CCTV as he approaches the car's trunk. He janks it open, breaking the lock. Inside he opens a metal case which contains five clear drip bags filled with bright blue fluid.]
[Four young men and a young woman sit up in hospital beds. The blue fluid is fed intravenously into their arms. The drip bags hang on stands beside them. They're all fit and muscular. One man, Josef, flexes a huge biceps. Josef is screaming, dragged into a cell and left on a bed.]
Josef / Super Soldier #1: It hurts! [He struggles in leather bindings. A viewing slot is closed.]
[Karpov is sitting at a desk in a corridor, making notes and listening. Karpov opens the door to a lab and switches on the light. Josef is sitting on a bed. He looks up at Karpov.]
[Bucky and Josef fight each other in a barred chamber. The four others who were given the blue liquid are there. Josef kicks with enormous power, sending Bucky flying. Watching Karpov folds his arms.
Vasily Karpov: Очень хорошо, Иосиф. ([subtitled] Good work.)
[A medic takes Josef's pulse and Josef slams him onto the floor. A soldier clubs Josef onto the back with no effect. Karpov gets behind Bucky and aims a gun.]
Vasily Karpov: Солдат, вытащи меня отсюда! ([subtitled] Get me out of here.)
[Josef and the other four Winter Soldiers effortlessly dispatch a squad of Soldiers. Bucky escorts covering Karpov from the barred chamber, batting guards aside.]
Steve Rogers: Who were they?
Bucky Barnes: Their most elite death squad. More kills than anyone in HYDRA history. And that was before the serum.
Sam Wilson: They all turn out like you?
Bucky Barnes: Worse.
Steve Rogers: The doctor, could he control them?
Bucky Barnes: Enough.
Steve Rogers: Said he wanted to see an empire fall.
Bucky Barnes: With these guys he could do it. They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight, infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize, They can take a whole country down in one night. You'd never see them coming.
Sam Wilson: [Sam steps up to Steve.] This would have been a lot easier a week ago.
Steve Rogers: If we call Tony . . .
Sam Wilson: No, he won't believe us.
Steve Rogers: Even if he did . . .
Sam Wilson: Who knows if the Accords would let him help.
Steve Rogers: We're on our own.
Sam Wilson: Maybe not. I know a guy.
Secretary Ross: I don't suppose you have any idea where they are?
Tony Stark: We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered. Recon's flying 24/7. They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
Secretary Ross: You don't get it, Stark. It's not yours to handle. It's clear you can't be objective. I'm putting Special Ops on this.
Natasha Romanoff: What happens when the shooting starts? What, do you kill Steve Rogers?
Secretary Ross: If we're provoked. Barnes would've been eliminated in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers. There are dead people who would be alive now. Feel free to check my math.
Tony Stark: All due respect, you're not going to solve this with boys in bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in.
Secretary Ross: How would that end any differently from the last time?
Tony Stark: Because this time, I won't be wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed.
Secretary Ross: 36 hours. Barnes. Rogers. Wilson.
Tony Stark: Thank you, sir. [Tony rubs his hand on his chest and slumps, exhaling.] My left arm is numb, is that normal?
Natasha Romanoff: [She pats him on the shoulder.] You alright?
Tony Stark: Always. [He has a massive black eye and a cut on his brow.] 36 hours, jeez.
Natasha Romanoff: We're seriously understaffed.
Tony Stark: Oh, yeah. It'd be great if we had a Hulk right about now. Any shot?
Natasha Romanoff: No. You really think he'd be on our side?
Tony Stark: No.
Natasha Romanoff: I have an idea.
Tony Stark: Me too. Where's yours?
Natasha Romanoff: Downstairs. Where's yours? [Tony smiles slightly.]
[Queens, New York. Peter Parker walks out of an elevator holding a DVD-player and with a backpack on his shoulder. He walks into an apartment where his Aunt May is sitting on the couch with Tony Stark.]
Peter Parker: Hey, May.
May Parker: Mmm. Hey. How was school today?
Peter Parker: Okay. This crazy car parked outside . . . [Peter sees Tony and his eyes widen.]
Tony Stark: Oh, Mr. Parker.
Peter Parker: Um . . . [He takes out his earphones.] What--what are you doing . . .? Hey! Uh, I'm--Im--I'm Peter.
Tony Stark: Tony.
Peter Parker: What are . . .what are you--what are you--what are you doing here?
Tony Stark: It's about time we met. You've been getting my e-mails, right?
Peter Parker: Yeah. Yeah.
Tony Stark: Right?
Peter Parker: Regarding the . . .
May Parker: You didn't tell me about the grant.
Peter Parker: About the grant.
Tony Stark: The September Foundation.
Peter Parker: Right.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Remember when you applied?
Peter Parker: Yeah.
Tony Stark: I approved, so now we're in business.
May Parker: You didn't tell me anything. What's up with that? You keeping secrets from me now?
Peter Parker: Why, I just, I just . . . I just know how much you love surprises, so I thought I would let you know . . . wh . . . anyway, what did I apply for?
Tony Stark: That's what I'm here to hash out.
Peter Parker: Okay. Hash, hash out, okay.
Tony Stark: It's so hard for me to believe that she's someone's aunt.
May Parker: Yeah, well, we come in all shapes and sizes, you know?
Tony Stark: This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
Peter Parker: Let me just stop you there.
Tony Stark: Yeah?
Peter Parker: Is this grant, like, got money involved or whatever? No?
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Peter Parker: Yeah?
Tony Stark: It's pretty well funded.
Peter Parker: Wow.
Tony Stark: Look who you're talking to. Can I have 5 minutes with him?
May Parker: Sure.
Tony Stark: [In Peter's bedroom Tony bolts the door and spits out the walnut loaf.] As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad. [He notices Peter's collection of old computers.] Whoa, what do we have here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army?
Peter Parker: Uh, the garbage, actually.
Tony Stark: You're a dumpster diver.
Peter Parker: Yeah, I was . . . anyway, look, um, I definitely did not apply for your grant.
Tony Stark: Ah-ah! Me first.
Peter Parker: Okay.
Tony Stark: Quick question of the rhetorical variety. [He pulls out his phone which projects a video of Peter Parker in his Spider-Man outfit.] That's you, right?
Peter Parker: Um, no. What do you. What do you mean?
Tony Stark: Yeah. Look at you go. Wow! Nice catch. 3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. That's not easy. You got mad skills.
Peter Parker: That's all- That's all on YouTube, though, right? I mean, that's where you found that? Because you know that's all fake. It's all done on the computer.
Tony Stark: Mm-Hmm.
Peter Parker: It's like that video. What is it?
Tony Stark: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . . . oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?
Peter Parker: Exactly.
Tony Stark: Oh, what have we here?
Peter Parker: [Peter hides his Spider-Man suit.] Uh . . . that's a . . .
Tony Stark: So. You're the . . . Spider . . . ling. Crime-fighting Spider . . .you're Spider-Boy?
Peter Parker: [Peter folds his arms petulantly.] S . . . Spider-Man.
Tony Stark: Not in that onesie, you're not.
Peter Parker: It's not a onesie. [Tony picks up the suit.] I don't believe this. I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark. Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there and . . . Algebra test. Nailed it!
Tony Stark: Who else knows? Anybody?
Peter Parker: Nobody.
Tony Stark: Not even your . . . unusually attractive aunt?
Peter Parker: No. No, no. No, no. If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out.
Tony Stark: You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that?
Peter Parker: I did.
Tony Stark: Climbing the walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves?
Peter Parker: It's a long story. I was uh . . .
Tony Stark: Lordy! Can you even see in these?
Peter Parker: Yes. Yes, I can! I can. I can-I can see in those. Okay? It's just that… when whatever happened, happened . . . it's like my senses have been dialed to 11. There's way too much input, so . . . they just kinda help me focus.
Tony Stark: You're in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom. 100-point restoration. That's why I'm here. [Peter sits on his bed and looks at Tony.] Why you doing this? I gotta know. What's your MO? What gets you outta that twin bed in the morning?
Peter Parker: Because . . . [he fiddles with his fingers] because l've been me my whole life, and l've had these powers for 6 months.
Tony Stark: Mm-Hmm.
Peter Parker: I read books, I build computers . . . and--and yeah. I would love to play football. But I couldn't then so I shouldn't now.
Tony Stark: Sure, because you're different.
Peter Parker: Exactly. But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not. When you can do the things that I can, but you don't . . . [Tony leans closer.] and then the bad things happen . . . they happen because of you.
Tony Stark: [he looks affected by Peter's words.] So you wanna look out for the little guy? You wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right?
Peter Parker: Yeah. Yeah just looking out . . . for the little guy. That's--that's what it is.
Tony Stark: [He slowly steps over to Peter whose leg is stretched out on the bed. Tony looks down at it.] I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg. [Peter moves along. Tony sits beside him and raises his hand. He hesitantly clasps Peter's shoulder.] You got a passport?
Peter Parker: Uh, no. I don't even have a driver's license.
Tony Stark: You ever been to Germany?
Peter Parker: No.
Tony Stark: Oh, you'll love it.
Peter Parker: I can't go to Germany!
Tony Stark: Why?
Peter Parker: I got . . . homework.
Tony Stark: I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
Peter Parker: I'm---I'm being serious! I can't just drop out of school!
Tony Stark: Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.
Peter Parker: [He webs Tony's hand to the door.] Don't tell Aunt May.
Tony Stark: Alright, Spider-Man. [They share an earnest look before Tony returns to his usual attitude.] Get me out of this.
Peter Parker: Sorry, I'll get the . . .
[Night, at Avengers' HQ. Vision floats above the floor. An explosion in the distance lights up the room for a moment. Vision and Wanda look out of the window.]
Wanda Maximoff: What is it?
Vision: Stay here, please.
[Vision goes. Suddenly Wanda compels a knife across the room. It stops dead in front of Clint's head.]
Clint Barton: Guess I shoulda knocked.
Wanda Maximoff: Oh my god! What are you doing here?
Clint Barton: Disappointing my kids. [He shoots arrows to both sides of the room.] I'm supposed to go water-skiing. Cap needs our help. Come on.
Vision: Clint! [Wanda and Clint stop.] You should not be here.
Clint Barton: [He turns around.] Really? I retire for, what, like five minutes, and it all goes to shit.
Vision: Please consider the consequences of your actions.
Clint Barton: Okay, they're considered. Okay, we gotta go. [Vision is held in a force field, crackling and sparkling between the two arrows.] It's this way.
Wanda Maximoff: I've caused enough problems.
Clint Barton: [Frowning Clint runs back from the door.] You gotta help me, Wanda. Look, you wanna mope, can go to high school. You wanna make amends, you get off your ass. Shit. [Vision breaks the force field with his mind stone. He punches Clint to the floor, Clint recovers quickly.] I knew I should've stretched. [He extends a baton and tries to hit Vision, but the blows go through him. Clint resorts to punches, then tries the baton again. It breaks. Clint tries to kick Vision, but his leg goes right through him. Vision gets Clint in a headlock.]
Vision: Clint, you can't overpower me.
Clint Barton: I know I can't. But she can.
Wanda Maximoff: Vision, that's enough. Let him go. I'm leaving.
Vision: I can't let you.
Wanda Maximoff: [She holds her hands apart, glowing with energy. Clint slips from Vision's grasp.] I'm sorry.
Vision: [He falters.] If you do this . . . they will never stop being afraid of you.
Wanda Maximoff: I can't control their fear, only my own. [She moves closer. Vision glows from within and crashes through the floor, and several floors beneath. Wanda and Clint stand over the holes in the floors.]
Clint Barton: Oh . . . come on. We got one more stop.
[Back at the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre:]
Attache: It's just a matter of time. Our satellites are running facial, bio-metric, and behavioral pattern scans.
Security Chief: [to Natasha who's standing in their way] Move, or you will be moved.
T'Challa: As entertaining as that would be . . .
Natasha Romanoff: You really think you can find him?
T'Challa: My resources are considerable.
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, it took the world 70 years to find Barnes . . . so you could probably do that in about half the time.
T'Challa: You know where they are.
Natasha Romanoff: I know someone who does.
[Under an overpass:]
Sharon Carter: Not sure you understand the concept of a getaway car.
Steve Rogers: It's low profile.
Sharon Carter: Good, because this stuff tends to draw a crowd. [She opens the trunk of her car, revealing Steve's and Sams's gear.]
Bucky Barnes: [He sits behind Sam in the getaway car.] Can you move your seat up?
Sam Wilson: No.
Steve Rogers: I owe you again.
Sharon Carter: Keeping a list. [She glances at Bucky.] You know, he kinda tried to kill me.
Steve Rogers: Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too. They're going to come looking for you.
Sharon Carter: I know.
[They kiss.]
Steve Rogers: Thank you, Sharon.
Sharon Carter: That was . . .
Steve Rogers: Late.
Sharon Carter: Damn right. I should go.
Steve Rogers: Okay.
[On the 6th level of a parking garage at the Leipzig/Halle airport. Steve drives into the parking lot in the battered, old car. He parks by a grey van and gets out.]
Clint Barton: Cap.
Steve Rogers: You know I wouldn't have called If I had any other choice.
Clint Barton: Hey man, you're doing me a favor. Besides, I owe a debt.
Steve Rogers: Thanks for having my back.
Wanda Maximoff: It was time to get off my ass.
Steve Rogers: How about our other recruit?
Clint Barton: He's rarin' to go. Had to put a little coffee in him, but… he should be good.
Scott Lang: What timezone is this?
Clint Barton: Come on. Come on.
Scott Lang: [Scott shakes Steve's hand with an amazed look.] Captain America.
Steve Rogers: Mr. Lang.
Scott Lang: It's an honor. I'm shaking your hand too long. Wow! This is awesome! Captain America. [He looks at Wanda.] I know you, too. You're great! [He turns back and feels Steve's shoulders.] Jeez. Ah, look, I wanna say, I know you know a lot of super people, so . . . thinks for thanking of me. [(sic!) To Sam.] Hey, man!
Sam Wilson: What's up, Tic Tac?
Scott Lang: Uh, good to see you. Look, what happened last time when I . . .
Sam Wilson: It was a great audition, but it'll . . . it'll never happen again.
Steve Rogers: They tell you what we're up against?
Scott Lang: Something about some . . . psycho-assassins?
Steve Rogers: We're outside the law on this one. So, if you come with us, you're a wanted man.
Scott Lang: Yeah, well, what else is new?
Bucky Barnes: We should get moving.
Clint Barton: We got a chopper lined up.
Man on PA #2: Dies ist eine Notsituation. Alle Passagiere müssen den Flughafen sofort evakuieren. (This is an emergency. All passengers must evacuate the airport immediately.)
Bucky Barnes: They're evacuating the airport.
Sam Wilson: Stark.
Scott Lang: Stark?
Steve Rogers: Suit up.
[Steve in his uniform strides through an underpass, then jogs onto a private runway, heading for a grounded chopper. An electro-disabler slams onto the chopper and Steve looks up. Iron Man and War Machine decent.]
Tony Stark: Wow, it's so weird how you run into people at the airport. Don't you think that's weird?
James Rhodes: Definitely weird.
Steve Rogers: Hear me out, Tony. That doctor, the psychiatrist, he's behind all of this.
T'Challa: [T'Challa leaps over a truck.] Captain.
Steve Rogers: Your highness.
Tony Stark: Anyway, Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out?
Steve Rogers: You're after the wrong guy.
Tony Stark: Your judgment is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.
Steve Rogers: And there are five more super soldiers just like him. I can't let the doctor find them first, Tony. I can't.
Natasha Romanoff: Steve . . . you know what's about to happen. Do you really wanna punch your way out of this one?
Tony Stark: All right, I've run out of patience. Underoos! [Peter shoots a web, stealing Steve's shield and binding his hands.] Nice job, kid.
Peter Parker: Thanks. Well, I could've stuck the landing a little better. It's just the new suit… Well, it's nothing, Mr. Stark. It's--it's perfect. Thank you.
Tony Stark: Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation.
Peter Parker: Okay. Cap . . . Captain. Big fan, I'm Spider-Man.
Tony Stark: Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Just . . .
Peter Parker: Hey, everyone.
Tony Stark: . . . Good job.
Steve Rogers: You've been busy.
Tony Stark: And you've been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint. 'Rescuing' Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave, a safe place. I'm trying to keep . . . I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.
Steve Rogers: You did that when you signed.
Tony Stark: Alright, We're done. You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna come with us. NOW! Because it's us! Or a squad of J-SOC guys . . . with no compunction about being impolite. [Steve looks aside.] Come on.
Sam Wilson: [He radios Steve.] We found it. Their Quinjet's in hanger five, north runway.
Steve Rogers: [Steve holds his hands up and Clint shoots the web off.] Alright, Lang.
Peter Parker: Hey, guys, something . . .
James Rhodes: Whoa. What--what the hell was that?
Scott Lang: [He retrieves Steve's shield.] I believe this is yours, Captain America.
Tony Stark: Oh, great. Alright, there's two on the parking deck. One of them's Maximoff, I'm gonna grab her. Rhodey, you want to take Cap?
James Rhodes: Got two in the terminal, Wilson and Barnes.
T'Challa: Barnes is mine!
Peter Parker: Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?
Tony Stark: What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web 'em up.
Peter Parker: Okay, copy that!
T'Challa: Move, Captain. I won't ask a second time.
Scott Lang: [He faces Natasha.] Look, I really don't want to hurt you.
Natasha Romanoff: I wouldn't stress about it. [She kicks him in the groin and he miniaturizes, throwing her head over heels. She zaps him off her wrist and he slams into a nearby truck, laving a small dent.]
Bucky Barnes: [In the terminal.] What the hell is that?
Sam Wilson: Everyone's got a gimmick now.
Peter Parker: [Peter swings through the glass wall and kicks Sam backwards. Bucky throws a punch, Peter catches his fist.] You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude! [Sam hits Peter.] You have the right to remain silent! [Mid-air Peter fends Sam off, then swings after him using his webs.]
[Iron Man shoots rockets that explode just beyond Clint and Wanda.]
[Steve fights hand to hand with T'Challa. War Machine locks on.]
James Rhodes: Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you but it ain't gonna tickle either. [He smacks Steve's shield with a mace.]
Tony Stark: [Hovering above the ground.] Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.
Wanda Maximoff: You locked me in my room.
Tony Stark: Okay. First, that's an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. Hey, Clint.
Clint Barton: Hey, man.
Tony Stark: Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?
Clint Barton: Well, I played 18, I shot 18. Just can't seem to miss. [He fires an arrow which Tony deflects.]
Tony Stark: First time for everything.
Clint Barton: Made you look.
[Suddenly a car slams past Iron Man. He looks up as dozens more come crashing down. Wanda rows her glowing hands until Iron Man is buried under a pile of cars.]
FRIDAY: Multiple contusions detected.
Tony Stark: Yeah, I detected that too.
[Peter wings through the rafters in the terminal, chasing Sam who flies backwards firing shots. Peter stops on a high beam.]
Peter Parker: Oh god. [Bucky throws something at him.] Hey buddy, I think you lost this! [Peter throws it back. Sam kicks him off the beam and Peter fires a web which sends Sam crashing to the floor. Peter webs Sam's wrist to a balcony railing.] Those wings carbon fiber?
Sam Wilson: Is this stuff coming out of you?
Peter Parker: That would explain the rigidity-flexibility ratio, which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.
Sam Wilson: I don't know if you've been a fight before but there's usually not this much talking.
Peter Parker: Alright, sorry, my bad. [He swings down and Bucky jumps in the way. Bucky and Sam fall through the glass down onto the next floor and Peter webs them.] Guys, look. I'd love to keep this up but I've only got one job here today and I gotta impress Mr. Stark, so, I'm really sorry. [Redwing drags Peter through the glass wall.] Wwahhhh!
Bucky Barnes: You couldn't have done that earlier?
Sam Wilson: I hate you.
[Outside Steve kicks War Machine out of the air, then sends T'Challa reeling. War Machine's mace is broken.]
James Rhodes: Great.
Scott Lang: Hey, Cap, heads up! [He throws Steve a miniature truck.] Throw it at this. Now! [Steve throws it and the truck enlarges, tumbling towards War Machine.]
James Rhodes: Oh, come on! [The truck lands and explodes.]
Scott Lang: Oh, man. I thought it was a water truck. Uh . . . sorry. [Scott and Steve run off.]
James Rhodes: Alright. Now, I'm pissed.
Natasha Romanoff: [Tony helps her up.] Is this, part of the plan?
Tony Stark: Well, my plan was to go easy on them. You wanna switch it up?
Clint Barton: [To Wanda as he spots the Quinjet.] There's our ride.
Steve Rogers: Come on!
[Steve's team runs towards the Quinjet. A fizzing stream of energy slices across the runway and they stop. Vision hovers overhead.]
Vision: Captain Rogers. I know you believe what you're doing is right. But for the collective good you must surrender now. [Tony's team arrives.]
Sam Wilson: What do we do, Cap?
Steve Rogers: We fight.
Natasha Romanoff: This is gonna end well. [The two teams stride towards each other with grim determination etched on their faces.]
Peter Parker: They're not stopping.
Tony Stark: Neither are we. [Everyone breaks into a sprint.]
[Steve blocks a punch as Iron Man lands. Clint fires an arrow at Vision. War Machine flies after Falcon and Bucky trades blows with T'Challa. An explosive arrow hits Iron Man. Natasha throws Scott, as Peter swings through the air, struggling to evade vehicles projected by Wanda. Bucky lands punches on T'Challa, Clint and Natasha battle with batons. Clint pins her down with his bow.]
Natasha Romanoff: We're still friends, right?
Clint Barton: Depends on how hard you hit me. [She spins him with her legs. As she's about to kick his head, her foot stops and glows bright red. Wanda projects Natasha down.]
Wanda Maximoff: You were pulling your punches. [Clint nods sheepishly.]
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky and T'Challa have each other by the throat.] I didn't kill your father.
T'Challa: Then why did you run? [T'Challa pulls Bucky's hand off his neck, then spins him and fly-kicks him backwards. He sprouts claws and aims for Bucky's neck, but Wanda stops his hand, then waves her arms and sends T'Challa crashing into a passenger gangway.]
[Peter swings past, Steve snaps the web with his shield.]
Peter Parker: That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all.
Steve Rogers: Look kid. There's a lot going on here that you don't understand.
Peter Parker: Mr. Stark said you'd say that. Wow. [he fires webs which stick to Steve's shield and ankle. He pulls and Steve slides towards him. Peter kicks him backwards, then rolls clear.] He also said to go for your legs. [As Steve runs to get his shield, Peter webs his hands and pulls. Steve grits his teeth, spins and somersaults, propelling Peter through the air.]
Sam Wilson: [Evading fire from Iron Man.] Clint, can you get him off me?
Clint Barton: Buckled in?
Scott Lang: Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go. Let's go! [Miniaturized Scott is on the tip of Clint's arrow. As he fires it, the head splits and Iron Man shoots the shards. Scott dives between Iron Man's splayed fingers and slips inside the Iron Man Suit at the shoulder joint.]
Steve Rogers: [Steve catches a web and tugs Peter towards him, knocking him down with the shield. Peter recovers and pulls himself up on top of a gangway.] Stark tell you anything else?
Peter Parker: That you're wrong. You think you're right. That makes you dangerous. [He swings down and Steve leaps to kick him backwards onto the gangway's leg.]
Steve Rogers: Guess he had a point. [He throws his shield at the leg and the gangway falls. Peter holds it up.] You got heart, kid. Where're you from?
Peter Parker: Queens.
Steve Rogers: Brooklyn. [Steve leaves Peter holding the gangway.]
Tony Stark: [Clint fires arrows at hovering Iron Man whose arm-lasers malfunction.] Friday?
FRIDAY: We have some weapon systems offline.
Tony Stark: They what?
Scott Lang: Oh, you're gonna have to take this into the shop.
Tony Stark: Who's speaking?
Scott Lang: It's your conscience. We don't talk a lot these days.
Tony Stark: Friday?
FRIDAY: Deploying fire suppression system.
Scott Lang: Uh -oh. Oh boy. Whoa! [Inside the suit Scott sprints through narrow banks of components, chased by a rolling cloud of CO2. He's ejected from the suit.]
Bucky Barnes: [To Steve.] We gotta go. That guy's probably in Siberia by now.
Steve Rogers: We gotta draw out the flyers. I'll take Vision. You get to the jet.
Sam Wilson: No, you get to the jet! Both of you! [Being chased by War Machine.] The rest of us aren't getting out of here.
Clint Barton: As much as I hate to admit it, if we're gonna win this one, some of us might have to lose it.
Sam Wilson: This isn't the real fight, Steve.
Steve Rogers: Alright, Sam, what's the play?
Sam Wilson: We need a diversion, something big.
Scott Lang: I got something kind of big, but I can't hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell. And if I tear myself in half . . . don't come back for me.
Bucky Barnes: He's gonna tear himself in half?
Steve Rogers: You're sure about this, Scott?
Scott Lang: I do it all the time. I mean once . . . in a lab. Then I passed out. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the BOSS! [He leaps from mobile stairs and lands on War Machine's back as he flies past. He operates his suit's wrist, shuts his eyes and activates a remote. Scott grows into a towering Behemoth and grabs War Machine's leg.]
Peter Parker: Holy shit!
James Rhodes: Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now.
Steve Rogers: I guess that's the signal.
Sam Wilson: Way to go, Tic Tac!
Tony Stark: Give me back my Rhodey. [Sam flies feet first into Iron Man.]
Peter Parker: I got him! [Scott sends War Machine flying and Peter catches him with a web.]
[Scott kicks a bus towards T'Challa. Vision descends and braces himself, splitting the bus in two and protecting T'Challa from harm. T'Challa spots Steve and Bucky sprinting past. Chasing Sam Iron Man evades Scott swinging the wing of a plane at him.]
Tony Stark: Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose, I'm open to suggestion.
[Sam arrows towards Iron Man, firing Red Wing which cracks into Tony's helmet. Scott blocks T'Challa's path.]
Scott Lang: You wanna get to them… you gotta go through me. [He sweeps his gigantic foot through the crates T'Challa's standing on, smashing them to pieces. Scott is engulfed in explosions as War Machine swoops towards him with Peter clinging to a web stuck to War Machine's back. He fires more webs and wraps them around Scott's over-sized arms.]
[Clint fires arrows at T'Challa who catches two right in front of his face. After the arrowheads explode he drops them and rises extending his claws.]
Clint Barton: We haven't met yet. [He flattens his bow and spins it around.] I'm Clint.
T'Challa: I don't care. [Wielding the bow like a staff Clint attacks T'Challa who a acrobatically ducks then counters with a high kick.]
[Giant Ant-Man punches War Machine in the air and swings a gangway towards him as he recovers. War Machine opens fire and the gangway disintegrates. Scott tries to stamp on War Machine who dives clear evading a lunge of Scott's hand. War Machine is struck by something.]
James Rhodes: Ahhh! [Wanda waves her hands flinging vehicles into War Machines path.]
Scott Lang: Get off. [Distracted by Peter Ant-Man doesn't spot Vision curling into a ball and ramming into him. Vision spots Steve and Bucky approaching the hangar as Ant-Man wavers. He simply floats through Ant-Man's chest. Something just flew in me! [Vision fires a shining beam of energy from his mind stone and the control tower collapses towards the entrance of the hangar. Wanda struggles to slow its collapse. Then War Machine descends behind her fires a sonic disruptor. Wanda holds her head and screams. The tower falls all around Steve and Bucky, but they make it into the hangar where Natasha is waiting for them.]
Natasha Romanoff: You're not gonna stop.
Steve Rogers: You know I can't.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm gonna regret this. [She stuns T'Challa who's arrived behind them.] Go. [Steve and Bucky run for the Quinjet as she keeps T'Challa at bay.]
Peter Parker: [Outside] Hey, guys, you ever see that really old movie, Empire Strikes Back?
James Rhodes: Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?
Tony Stark: I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him. He's on the young side.
Peter Parker: [He swings towards Ant-Man.] You know that part . . . where they're on the snow planet . . . with the walking thingies? [He wraps webs around Scott's legs.]
Tony Stark: Maybe the kid's on to something.
James Rhodes: High now, Tony. Go high.
Peter Parker: [He swings around and around Ant-Man's legs as Iron Man and War Machine power towards his head, both landing blows together.] YES! Ha ha! That was awesome! [Giant Ant-Man topples. A flailing limb catching Peter and knocking him flying just before Scott slams into the ground on his back. He returns to normal size and removes the face-plate of his helmet, grimacing.]
Scott Lang: Does anyone have any orange slices?
Tony Stark: [He lands by Peter who's in a heap. Retracting the helmet Tony looks concerned.] Kid, you alright?
Peter Parker: Hey! Get off me!
Tony Stark: Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
Peter Parker: Oh. Hey, man.
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Peter Parker: That was scary.
Tony Stark: Yeah. You're done. Alright?
Peter Parker: What?
Tony Stark: You did a good job. Stay down.
Peter Parker: No, I'm good. I'm fine.
Tony Stark: Stay down.
Peter Parker: No, it's good I gotta get him back!
Tony Stark: You're going home or I'll call Aunt May! You're done!
Peter Parker: Wait. Mr. Stark, wait! I'm not done, I'm not . . . [He slumps down.] Okay, I'm done. I'm done.
Natasha Romanoff: [In the partially wrecked hangar the Quinjet's engines fire and the guns blast debris from the entrance. Natasha keeps T'Challa held until the jet rises. Black Panther leaps, but can't keep hold and the Quinjet flies out of the hangar. War Machine flies after it. In the hangar:] I said I'd help you find him, not catch him. There's a difference.
Vision: [Outside Vision kneels beside Wanda and gently holds her in his arms. She pants for breath.] I'm sorry.
Wanda Maximoff: Me, too.
Vision: It's as I said. Catastrophe.
[Piloting the Quinjet, Steve looks over his shoulder and spots War Machine encroaching to the right. Steve pushes forward on the thrusters. Iron Man flies beside War Machine and Falcon follows them.]
James Rhodes: Vision, I got a bandit on my six. [Falcon fires small explosives which erupt and buffet War Machine.] Vision! You copy? Target his thrusters, turn him into a glider.
[Vision takes aim and fires his head laser. Falcon spots it coming and tucks into a tumble. The laser overshoots and slices through the core on War Machines chest plate. War Machine loses power and goes into a spinning free fall.]
Tony Stark: Rhodey! [Iron Man and Falcon dive.]
James Rhodes: Tony, I'm flying dead stick. [As he plunges the suit emits black smoke. Iron Man swoops down towards him. Rhodes' eyes start to close.]
Tony Stark: RHODES! [Mar Machine smacks into a wide, grassy field just before Iron Man lands nearby. His helmet retracts and he pulls off War Machine's face plate. Rhodes' eyes are closed and there's blood on his face.] Read vitals.
FRIDAY: Heartbeat detected. Emergency medical is on its way.
Sam Wilson: [He swoops down and lands on his feet. His wings retract.] I'm sorry. [Tony zaps Falcon backwards with a blast of energy from the palm of his suit. Vision glides to the ground just in front of Falcon. Stony faced Tony remains with his arms around War Machine.]
[Somewhere in Siberia, Zemo makes a phone call.]
German Innkeeper: Guten Morgen, Zimmerservice? (Good morning. Room service.)
Helmut Zemo: Guten Morgen Frau Leiber. Zimmer 201 hier (Good morning, Mrs. Leiber. [subtitled] This is room 201.)
German Innkeeper: Ah, Herr Müller. Speck und schwarzer Kaffee für Sie, ja? (Ah, Mr. Müller. [subtitled] Bacon and black coffee again today?)
Helmut Zemo: Wie gut Sie mich kennen. ([subtitled] You know me so well.)
[In his room in Berlin, Germany.]
German Innkeeper: Hallo? Ihr Frühstück ist hier. Darf ich mich reinlassen? Herr Müller? Herr Müller? Oh mein Gott! ([subtitled] Hello? Your breakfast is here. May I let myself in? Mr Müller? Mr Müller? Oh God!) [She comes in and discovers the dead body of Dr. Theo Broussard in the bathtub.]
[Steve flies the Quinjet towards mountains, Bucky sits behind him.]
Bucky Barnes: What's gonna happen to your friends?
Steve Rogers: [Steve stares ahead, heavyhearted. He sighs and shakes his head.] Whatever it is… I'll deal with it.
Bucky Barnes: [He looks thoughtful.] I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.
Steve Rogers: [He glances around at Bucky.] What you did all those years . . . it wasn't you. You didn't have a choice.
Bucky Barnes: I know. But I did it.
[At a hospital Rhodes lies inside an CT-scanner. He's in a blue gown covering his body. Tony paces up to Vision who watches Rhodes grave faced.]
Tony Stark: How did this happen?
Vision: I became distracted.
Tony Stark: I didn't think that was possible.
Vision: Neither did I. [Tony leaves Vision looking in on Rhodes. Along the corridor Tony spots an equally concerned Natasha.]
[Tony and Natasha stand on a balcony looking towards a row of trees.]
Tony Stark: The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1. Extreme laceration in the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis.
Natasha Romanoff: Steve's not gonna stop. If you don't either, Rhodey's gonna be the best case scenario.
Tony Stark: You let them go, Nat.
Natasha Romanoff: We played this wrong.
Tony Stark: 'We'? Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA.
Natasha Romanoff: Are you incapable of letting go of your ego for one goddamn second?
Tony Stark: T'Challa told Ross what you did, so . . . they're coming for you.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm not the one that needs to watch their back. [She walks away.]
Tony Stark: [He activates holographic images appearing on his wrist device.] What am I looking at, Friday?
FRIDAY: Priority upload from Berlin police.
Tony Stark: Fire up the chopper.
[Tony flies over a stormy sea in the chopper. He looks surveillance images on a tablet computer.]
FRIDAY: The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. He was met by this man.
Tony Stark: Did you run facial recognition yet?
FRIDAY: What do I look like?
Tony Stark: Uh, I don't know. I've been picturing a red head.
FRIDAY: You must be thinking of someone else.
Tony Stark: Must be.
FRIDAY: The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo, Sokovian Intelligence. [Tony projects the image.] Zemo ran Echo Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad.
Tony Stark: So, what happened to the real Broussard?
FRIDAY: He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes.
Tony Stark: Son of a bitch. Get this to Ross.
FRIDAY: Yes, Boss.
[A wide and flat, snow covered landscape. A mountain looms on the horizon. A caterpillar truck stops on the windswept mountain plateau. Zemo gets out of the vehicle. Set on rocks is an entrance with huge, rusted double doors. Zemo hacks away at the wall beside the doors. he uncovers a control panel and keys in a code whilst referring to the red book. The huge, curved double doors break open a crack. Zemo pulls them open wider. He shines a flash light and pulls down the hood of his coat.
Inside is a vast, gloomy space cramped with shelves stacked with filing boxes. Zemo moves a ladder along and searches the boxes. he climbs up the ladder and removes a filing box labeled: 'декабря 1991' (December 1991).
Zemo walks along a tunnel which opens into a cavernous chamber with a high ceiling. He carries a VHS cassette and a flash light. Standing around the chamber a five large, clear sided capsules. They glow a gold yellow inside. Frowning Zemo walks up to one of the capsules and shines his flash light inside. In the capsule, motionless in a state of suspended animation is the enhanced soldier Josef.]
[Tony flies the shopper low over the broiling sea. He operates the chopper with a touch screen computer in a wall panel.]
Guard: [on radio] This is the Raft Prison Control. You're clear for landing, Mr. Stark.
[The sea swells and surges as Raft Prison rises up from beneath. A huge, fortified, circular structure with small lights around the sides. Two semi-circular doors open up in the flat circular top. The chopper lands on a helipad and the doors close above it. Tony, who's left arm is in a sling walks up to Secretary Ross.]
Tony Stark: So? You got the files? Let's reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.
Secretary Ross: You seriously think I'm gonna listen to you after that fiasco in Leipzig? You're lucky you're not in one of these cells. [Ross looks at Tony sternly and leads on through a thick, steel security door. Soldiers stand guard in an operations room. Tony looks at a surveillance screen. it shows Wanda, sitting hunched and bedraggled in a cramped prison cell.]
[Another security door opens. Tony walks into a chamber surrounded by large, bared windows. Beyond the windows are a number of prison cells. Tony takes in his surroundings.]
Clint Barton: [clapping] The Futurist, gentlemen! The Futurist is here! He sees all! He knows what's best for you, whether your like it or not.
Tony Stark: Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they'll put you here. Come on.
Clint Barton: [spits] Yeah, well, you knew they'd put us somewhere, Tony.
Tony Stark: Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. You know, this place is for maniacs. This is a place for . . .
Clint Barton: Criminals? [He stands up.] Criminals, Tony. Think that's the word you're looking for. [He eyes Tony through the bars.] Right? That didn't used to mean me. Or Sam, or Wanda. But here we are.
Tony Stark: Because you broke the law.
Clint Barton: Yeah.
Tony Stark: I didn't make you.
Clint Barton: La, la, la, la, la . . .
Tony Stark: You read it, you broke it.
Clint Barton: La, la, la, la la…
Tony Stark: Alright, you're all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don't understand, why didn't you think about them before you chose the wrong side? [He walks away.]
Clint Barton: You gotta watch your back with this guy. There's a chance he's gonna break it.
Scott Lang: Hank Pym always said, you never can trust a Stark.
Tony Stark: Who are you?
Scott Lang: Come on, man.
Sam Wilson: How's Rhodes?
Tony Stark: They're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow. So . . . fingers cross. [Sam shakes his head.]What do you need? They feed you yet?
Sam Wilson: [He raises his eyebrows.] You're the good cop now?
Tony Stark: I'm just the guy who needs to know where Steve went.
Sam Wilson: Well, you better go get a bad cop, because you're gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass to get information out of me.
Tony Stark: Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'. We got about 30 seconds before they realize it's not their equipment.
Secretary Ross: [In the operations room.] What did you do? Get it back up!
Tony Stark: [Back in the cell.] Just look. Because that is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes. [He shoes a holographic image of Doctor Broussard.] Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong.
Sam Wilson: That's a first.
Tony Stark: Cap is definitely off the reservation but he's about to need all the help he can get. We don't know each other very well. You don't have to…
Sam Wilson: Hey, it's alright. [Tony leans closer to the window. Sam sighs and looks uneasy.] Look, I'll tell you… but you have to go alone and as a friend.
Tony Stark: Easy.
[Tony walks to his chopper.]
Secretary Ross: Stark? Did he give you anything on Rogers?
Tony Stark: Nope. Told me to go to hell. I'm going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I'll put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink. [Ross stares at Tony who smiles as he gets in the chopper and the door slides shut. The chopper rises off the helipad and flies away. The doors close on the prison roof.]
[Sitting in the chopper Tony un-clips the sling holding his left arm. He cradles his arm in his hand for a moment. He slowly reaches out the injured arm and presses a button on a panel. The Iron Man Suit wraps itself around Tony, a hatch opens and he flies out of the chopper as Iron Man. He speeds through dark clouds. Close behind T'Challa is at the controls of a Quinjet.]
[Steve brings his Quinjet into land besides Zemo's caterpillar truck on the remote icy mountain top. The jet's wings fold up beside the fuselage.
On board Bucky pulls out rack of guns labeled 'Romanoff'. He takes a light machine gun.
Bucky and Steve stand together, waiting for the exit ramp to descend.]
Steve Rogers: You remember that time we had to ride back from Rockaway Beach in the back of that freezer truck?
Bucky Barnes: Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs?
Steve Rogers: You blew three bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead.
Bucky Barnes: What was her name again?
Steve Rogers: Dolores. You called her Doll.
Bucky Barnes: She's gotta be a hundred years old right now.
Steve Rogers: So are we, pal. [He clamps his hand on Bucky's shoulder.]
[Now wearing his helmet Steve walks with Bucky up to the entrance set in rock. The door is still open.]
Steve Rogers: He can't have been here more than a few hours.
Bucky Barnes: Long enough to wake them up.
[Steve leads them into the cast bunker. They travel down into the depths inside a caged elevator. it stops in the bowls of the bunker, doors slide open. Steve nods to Bucky and heaves up the cage door. Bucky readies his heavy duty machine gun and they walk along a corridor, keeping close to a wall. Bucky looks into an alcove full of junk then he and Steve move on up some stairs. At the sound of a loud thud they spin around, aiming down the corridor.]
Steve Rogers: You ready?
Bucky Barnes: Yeah.
[Double doors part, forced open by Iron Man. Steve stares in surprise. Tony walks towards Steve and Bucky and retracts the suit's helmet.]
Tony Stark: You seem a little defensive.
[Bucky keeps his gun up while Steve walks to meet Tony with his shield covering his body.]
Steve Rogers: It's been a long day.
Tony Stark: At ease, Soldier. I'm not currently after you.
Steve Rogers: Then why are you here?
Tony Stark: Could be your story's not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I'm here. I'd like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.
Steve Rogers: Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork. [He lowers his shield.] It's good to see you, Tony.
Tony Stark: You too, Cap. [to Bucky] Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here. You can drop . . . [Steve signs Bucky to lower his weapon and he does.]
[the three of them cautiously walk along a corridor. T'Challa in his Black Panther Suit is hiding around a corner, watching them.]
[With his helmet and face plate reengaged Iron Man leads Steve and Bucky towards the enormous chamber with the capsules standing in it.]
Tony Stark: I got heat signatures.
Steve Rogers: How many?
Tony Stark: Uh, one.
[As they enter the vast chamber the lights come on. Hazy, yellow mist descends within the capsules. As well as Josef, each one contains an enhanced soldier from the 1991 experiment. Steve and the others look around, bewildered.]
Helmut Zemo: [on speaker] If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep. [All of the enhanced soldiers have been shot in the head. Bucky stares at Josef's corpse.] Did you really think I wanted more of you?
Bucky Barnes: What the hell?
Helmut Zemo: I'm grateful to them, though. They brought you here. [Zemo appears in a control room. Steve hurls his shield but it flies back.] Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.
Tony Stark: I'm betting I could beat that.
Helmut Zemo: Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr. Stark. Given time. But then you'd never know why you came.
Steve Rogers: You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here? [Black Panther watches from the shadows. Steve looks at Zemo through a window.]
Helmut Zemo: I thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you. I followed you. But now that you're standing here, I just realized . . . there's a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. How nice to find a flaw.
Steve Rogers: You're Sokovian. Is that what this is about?
Helmut Zemo: Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell. No. I'm here because I made a promise.
Steve Rogers: [He studies Zemo.] You lost someone?
Helmut Zemo: [He looks grave, clicks his tongue.] I lost everyone. And so will you. [He plays surveillance footage from December 16th 1991. Steve steps over to the screen.] An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead . . . forever.
Tony Stark: [He looks at the freeze frame of a secluded road and the date, December 16 1991. His eyes rove, anxiously.] I know that road. What is this?
[The video plays. That car that the Winter Soldier forced off the road crashes into a tree. Tony watches intently as the Winter Soldier rides up and gets off his motorbike. Steve watches Tony's increasing unease. The driver lies on the ground beside the car. It's Tony's father, Howard.
Howard Stark: Help my wife. Please. Help.
[The Winter Soldier walks over and hoists him up by his hair. He stares at Howard's bloody face. Howard stares back pleadingly.]
Howard Stark: Sergeant Barnes?
Maria Stark: Howard!
[Tony glares at Bucky. In the video the Winter Soldier pounds Howard hard in the face with his metal fist.]
Maria Stark: Howard!
[In grief Tony closes his eyes for a moment. On screen his father slumps dead. The Winter Soldier puts him in the driver's seat with his face against the steering wheel. Tony stares in horror. Maria's in the passenger seat with blood streaked down her face. The Winter Soldier walks around and grips her throat. Expressionless he strangles Maria. Tony watches the screen stunned. The Winter Soldier walks up and aims a gun at the surveillance camera.
Steve watches Tony anxiously. Tony lunges towards Bucky, Steve stops him.]
Steve Rogers: Tony. Tony.
Tony Stark: [Consumed with grief and tears glistening in his eyes he turns and looks at Steve.] Did you know?
Steve Rogers: I didn't know it was him.
Tony Stark: Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?
Steve Rogers: Yes.
[Tony steps back, his chin jutting upwards twitchy. Tony reengages the Iron Man helmet. He punches Steve to the floor and deflects gunfire from Bucky, disarming him. he grabs Bucky and flies across the chamber. He slams him onto the floor, then jumps on his arms. Steve's shield hits Iron Man, distracting him. Steve barges him backwards, Iron Man shoulders him to the floor and shackles his ankles. Bucky punches Iron Man who just lifts him and slams him against a machine. Iron Man raises a fist but Bucky twists it. A rocket shoots out of Iron Man's arm, a fireball explodes. Steve slices his shackles as a towering structure of pipework collapses. Tony and Bucky are thrown down a level as twisted metal falls around them, showering sparks.]
Steve Rogers: [to Bucky] Get out of here!
[As Bucky bolts Iron Man fires, but misses. Steve lands in front of him. Bucky hits a control panel and the silo-styled door overhead starts to open.]
Steve Rogers: It wasn't him, Tony. Hydra had control of his mind!
Tony Stark: Move!
Steve Rogers: It wasn't him!
[Steve grabs Iron Man's ankle in mid air and smashes it. Iron Man blocks Steve by shooting down rubble, then falteringly flies up the tower.]
FRIDAY: Left boot jet failing. Flight systems compromised.
Tony Stark: Ah crap.
[Above him Bucky leaps from platform to platform. With stuttering jets Iron Man gives chase, then kicks Bucky and takes aim, but the energy bold rebounds off Steve's shield onto himself. Iron Man drops like a stone and lands on a lower platform.]
Steve Rogers: He's not going to stop. Go.
[As Iron Man soars upwards, Steve leaps and shoots a wire which wraps around Iron Man's neck and drags him back down. He deflects Steve's shield, then tries to target Bucky.]
Tony Stark: Come on, come on.
FRIDAY: Targeting system's knackered, boss.
Tony Stark: I'm eyeballing it. [His helmet retracts and he shuts one eye, taking aim at the opening hatch. He fires and hits the giant hinge which explodes, cutting of Bucky's escape route. He flies up, blocks two swings from an iron pipe from Bucky, then grabs him around the neck from behind.] Do you even remember them?
Bucky Barnes: I remember all of them.
[Bucky pushes them both from the walkway, Steve jumps into them to deflect their fall. Bucky lands on a platform while Tony and Steve land on the concrete floor besides opening in the wall where snow drifts in from outside]
Steve Rogers: This isn't gonna change what happened.
Tony Stark: I don't care. He killed my mom.
[They trade punches and Iron Man ends up pinning Steve down. Bucky picks up Captain America's shield and leaps down to help. As the two super soldiers fist fight with Iron Man the shield changes hands between them until Tony manages to zap Steve who is thrown back into the wall. Bucky struggles to hold Iron Man at bay as he unleashes an energy beam, then he forces Iron Man against the opposite wall and grips the glowing core in the chest of the Iron Man Suit. A blast of energy knocks Bucky down, metal arm completely blown away. Tony zaps him again. Steve rushes him with his shield up and Iron Man fires right at it]
[Zemo is outside, listening to a phone message.]
Zemo's Wife: You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.
T'Challa: [Sneaks up behind him] I almost kill the wrong man.
Helmut Zemo: Hardly an innocent one.
T'Challa: This is all you wanted? To see them rip each other apart.
Helmut Zemo: [Deletes the voice message] My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. He could see the Iron Man from the car window. I told my wife, "Don't worry. They are fighting in the city. We're miles from harm." When the dust cleared . . . and the screaming stopped. It took me two days until I found their bodies. My father . . . still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? They went home. I knew I couldn't kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them to kill each other . . . I'm sorry about your father. He seemed a good man. With a dutiful son.
T'Challa: Vengeance has consumed you. It's consuming them. [He blinks ruefully and retracts the claws in his gloves.] I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough.
Helmut Zemo: [Holding a gun Zemo smiles thinly.] Tell that to the dead. [He tries to shoot himself but T'Challa grabs him just as he fires.]
T'Challa: The living are not done with you yet.
[Tony and Steve are still fighting in the silo.]
FRIDAY: You can't beat him hand to hand.
Tony Stark: Analyse his fight pattern.
FRIDAY: Scanning! [Iron Man's HUD flashes red as Steve lands blow after blow.] Countermeasures ready.
Tony Stark: [He grabs Captain America's shield.] Let's kick his ass. [He flings the shield away then zaps Steve backwards, head over heels. Steve rises and Tony blocks his punches then zaps him to his knees, right in front of Bucky who's lying on his back.]
Steve Rogers: He's my friend.
Tony Stark: So was I. [He punches Steve then throws him back towards the gaps in the wall.] Stay down. Final warning.
Steve Rogers: [He struggles to his feet, his face bloody and his gate weary. He raises his fists and stares Iron Man down.] I can do this all day.
[Iron man raises his left palm ready to fire. Bucky grabs his leg and Tony spins, kicking him in the face. Steve grabs Iron Man and lifts him over his head, then throws him down, punches him and bashes his mask off with his shield before striking down hard on the suit's core.Tony looks horrified and glowers fearfully at Steve who pants for breath. Both have blood spattered across their faces. Steve looks back at Tony then shuts his eyes and slumps down. The shield remains upright, stuck upright in the center of the Iron Man Suit. When Steve struggles up again he takes hold of the shield, gripping the edge and pulling it free. He steps away from Tony who rolls painfully onto his side. Bucky lies bloodied but conscious, Steve reaches out and pulls him to his feet, holding him up as Tony looks on.]
Tony Stark: That shield doesn't belong to you. [Steve turns his back.] You don't deserve it. My father made that shield! [Steve stops, raises his chin, then drops the shield and walks away with Bucky's arm around his shoulder.]
[In a secure chamber at the Berlin UN bunker Zemo's contained in a prison pod, his ankles cuffed to his seat. Everett Ross enters the chamber.]
Everett Ross: Meals at eight and five. Toilet privileges twice a day. Raise your voice, zap. Touch the glass, zap. You step out of line, you deal with me. Please, step out of line. Hmm? [Zemo just stares.] So how does it feel? To spend all that time, all that effort . . . and, to see it fail so spectacularly?
Helmut Zemo: [He looks up to meet Everett's gaze.] Did it?
[Back at Avengers HQ, Tony is with Rhodes as he tentatively walks beside parallel bars with tech on his legs.]
Tony Stark: It's just the first pass.
James Rhodes: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of. Shock absorption. Lateral movement. Cup holder?
James Rhodes: You may wanna think about some AC down in . . . [He falls onto his hands.]
Tony Stark: Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
James Rhodes: No, no, don't. Don't help me. Don't help me. [He rises to his hands and knees, turns to sit on the floor beside Tony.] 138. 138 combat missions. That's how many I've flown, Tony. Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew 'em. Because the fight needed to be fought. It's the same with these Accords. I signed because it was the right thing to do. And, yeah, this sucks. This is . . . this is a bad beat. But it hasn't change my mind. I don't think. [He gives a crooked smile and takes Tony's hand.]
Tony Stark: You okay?
James Rhodes: Oh yeah.
FedEx Driver Stan Lee: [Knocks on the window with a packet in his hand.] Are you Tony "Stank"?
James Rhodes: Yes, this is--this is Tony "Stank". You're in the right place. Thank you for that! I'm never dropping that, by the way. Table for one, Mr. "Stank". Please, by the bathroom.
[Tony is alone, opens the package and finds an envelope and a phone inside.]
Steve Rogers: [letter to Stark] Tony, I'm glad you're back at the compound. I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine. I've been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army. My faith's in people, I guess. Individuals. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn't. I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but I can see now that I was really sparing myself, and I'm sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should . . . [As Steve reads his letter off screen it's indicated that he breaks his team out of the Raft.]
FRIDAY: Priority call from Secretary Ross. There's been a breach at the Raft prison.
Tony Stark: Yeah, put him through.
Secretary Ross: Tony, we have a problem.
Tony Stark: Ah, please hold.
Secretary Ross: No. Don't . . .
Steve Rogers: [letter to Stark] So, no matter what. I promise you, if you need us, if you need me, I'll be there.
[Wakanda, medical facility.]
Steve Rogers: You sure about this?
Bucky Barnes: I can't trust my own mind. So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head I think going back under is the best thing . . . for everybody. [He goes back into cryo.]
[Steve stands staring through a window, T'Challa walks towards him.]
Steve Rogers: Thank you for this.
T'Challa: Your friend and my father, they were both victims. If I can help one of them find peace…
Steve Rogers: You know, If they find out he's here . . . they'll come for him.
T'Challa: Let them try.
[In Peter's room on Queens. May speaks to him from somewhere in the apartment.]
May Parker: So. Who was it? Who hit you?
Peter Parker: Some guy. So itchy, man. God. [He fiddles with a wrist band.]
May Parker: What's "some guy's" name?
Peter Parker: Uh, Steve.
May Parker: Steve? From 12-C? With the overbite?
Peter Parker: No, no, no. You don't know him, he's from Brooklyn. [Peter's wrist band emits a red beam which he hides when his aunt comes into the room.] Ouch.
May Parker: Well . . . I hope you got a few good licks in.
Peter Parker: Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually. His friend was huge. Like huge. [May gives him ice in a towel.] That's way better. Thank you.
May Parker: Okay, tough guy. [She smiles broadly then leaves the room.]
Peter Parker: Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door? [He shines the red beam onto his bedroom ceiling and grins looking up at a glowing image of Spider-Man's mask.]

OVERHEAD SHOT: A ‘79 Cobra winds alongside the Missouri 
River, past swaying loosestrife, vibrant sugar maples, and 
oily self-pump gas stations.  A hazy sun glints off the hood 
of the Cobra which, like its descendant the Milano, is orange 
and teal. 

We MOVE DOWN AND IN on a fresh-faced girl of 18 in the 
passenger seat: MEREDITH QUILL. As “Brandy” blasts from the 
car stereo, she pushes her fine, feathered hair from her 
mouth, and sings along, out-of-tune -  

MEREDITH

Do do do do do do do do do do do!

The driver, a MYSTERIOUS MAN in his 30’s, dressed in sleek, 
mod attire, LAUGHS.  

Meredith LAUGHS too.  She SINGS and dances with abandon in 
her seat.  She’s a lively goofball, and it’s apparent where 
Peter Quill received much of his personality.

EXT. DAIRY QUEEN/WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

The Cobra pulls beside this Dairy Queen in a desolate area.  

EXT. WOODS BEHIND DAIRY QUEEN - MOMENTS LATER

The Mysterious Man helps Meredith down the steep hillside 
into the woods.  “Brandy” continues to play on the car stereo 
in the lot behind them.  Meredith GIGGLES.

MYSTERIOUS MAN

This way, my river lily.

MEREDITH

Where are you taking me?

The Mysterious Man shows her a STRANGE SPROUT nestled amongst 
the trees.  

A few inches tall and decidedly alien in nature, its delicate 
limbs twist and turn in a complex pattern.

MEREDITH (CONT’D)

Oh. It’s beautiful.

The Mysterious Man looks proudly at Meredith.  With a 
perpetually excited glint in his eye, and the air of a self-
empowerment guru, he is an intoxicating presence.

MYSTERIOUS MAN

I was afraid it wouldn’t take to 
the soil, but it rooted quickly. 

He nods toward the sky between the branches above.

MYSTERIOUS MAN (CONT’D)

Soon it will be everywhere - all 
across the universe, fulfilling 
life’s one true purpose.  

MEREDITH

Which is what?

MYSTERIOUS MAN

Expansion.

The Mysterious Man takes her in his arms.  He gazes into her 
eyes.  She grows almost teary.

MEREDITH

I’m not sure what you’re talking 
about. But I like the way you say 
it.

MYSTERIOUS MAN

My heart is yours, Meredith Quill.

MEREDITH

I can’t believe I fell in love with 
a spaceman.  

And they KISS, with passion, and love.  “DO DO DO DO DO DO DO 
DO DO DO DO!” sings Looking Glass as SOURCE BECOMES SCORE and 
we TILT DOWN to the plant. It TWITCHES AND GROWS AND TWISTS. 

We PUSH IN ON IT, where we see the plant is made, not only of 
cellulose and leaves, but of a BRIGHT COSMIC LIGHT. And we 
KEEPING PUSHING IN, INTO THE PLANT ITSELF, more FLESH-LIKE 
than you’d imagine, where COLORFUL BACTERIA OVERCOMES US as 
“BRANDY” DISTORTS AND TRANSFORMS into something epic.

O.S. A CRACK OF INTERDIMENSIONAL THUNDER

SUPER: 34 Years Later

EXT. THE SOVEREIGN - OUTER SPACE

An artificial, golden planet, made of interlocking orbs, 
revolves around a blue sun.  

We PUSH IN on THUNDEROUS INTERDIMENSIONAL CRACKS on one small 
patch of planet.

SUPER: THE SOVEREIGN
       M49 5IOL339P21+H9LNI31

I/E. POWER STATION - DAY

A DIMENSIONAL CRACK SNAPS in the sky overhead.  PETER QUILL 
looks from it to an old MATTEL ELECTRONICS FOOTBALL GAME 
converted into a tracker.  A RED DOT APPROACHES.  

QUILL

Showtime, a-holes! It’ll be here 
any minute!  

GAMORA (O.S.)

Which will be its loss.  

Quill turns toward GAMORA, loading a rifle.  DRAX, ROCKET, 
and BABY GROOT also ready themselves for battle in this 
grand, open-air power station. Dozens of BATTERIES are 
couched in conductor towers encircling them. Quill, Gamora, 
and Rocket wear flying rigs.  

QUILL

Is that a rifle?

GAMORA

You don’t know what a rifle is?

QUILL

I thought your thing was a sword.

GAMORA

We’ve been hired to stop an 
interdimensional beast from feeding 
on those batteries’ energy, and I’m 
going to stop it with a sword?

QUILL

(mumbling to himself)

Don’t look at me like I’m stupid. 
You’re the one being all 
inconsistent.

A LOUDER, LARGER CRACK: something seems to be fighting its 
way through the sky.

GAMORA

Drax, why aren’t you wearing one of 
Rocket’s aero-rigs?

DRAX

It hurts.

GAMORA

Hurts?

DRAX

(muttering)

I have sensitive nipples. 

Rocket, who is working on a pair of speakers wired to Quill’s 
Walkman, LAUGHS HARD at this. Drax points at him.

DRAX (CONT’D)

What about him?! What’s he doing?!

ROCKET

If I finish this, we can listen to 
tunes while we work.

DRAX

How is that a priority?

ROCKET

Blame Quill! He’s the one who loves 
music so much!

QUILL

I agree with Drax. It’s hardly 
important right now.

ROCKET

Oh, sure, okayyyy, Quill.

Rocket WINKS at him.

QUILL

No, I really agree with him.

ROCKET

Sure, I know.  

Rocket WINKS some more.

DRAX

I can clearly see you winking.

ROCKET

Damn. I’m using my left eye?

Rocket hears a small GROWL.  

He looks down and sees Baby Groot - newly unpotted, only nine 
inches tall or so - angrily THROWING ASIDE some foraging 
Orloni.  Then he looks up at Rocket, explaining:

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

They were not looking at you funny.

AN EVEN LARGER CRACK! 

Rocket swirls as a GIGANTIC BEAST - a hundred-foot-long 
Lovecraftian monstrosity - BREAKS THROUGH THE 
INTERDIMENSIONAL RIFT.  THE ABILISK is the color of a pinkie 
mouse with kaleidoscopic and deadly SPLATTER MATTER pulsing 
from its maw. 

ROCKET (CONT’D)

Well. That’s intense.

Rocket, Quill, and Gamora JET-PACK OUT OF THE WAY, while they 
BLAST at the creature.  Drax HOLLERS, CHARGING it with his 
twin blades. Quill TURNS ON his mask.

But we FOCUS on baby Groot, who trots up to the stereo 
speakers and Walkman.

He fiddles with two wires.  They SPARK, the stereo POWERS UP, 
and “MR. BLUE SKY” by ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA PLAYS as -

THE CREDITS START

Baby Groot DANCES IN-FOCUS in the foreground as the Guardians 
get PUMMELED by the beast OUT-OF-FOCUS in the background.  

Baby Groot’s dancing is arrhythmic and many of his “dance 
moves” are nonsensical mixtures of trembling, swaying, and 
making weird faces. 

But it is joyous.

As Groot struts, Quill comes ROLLING behind him. As he 
stands, he sees Groot dancing and looks at him, worried.

QUILL

Groot, look - !

A TENTACLE FLIES IN FROM OFF-SCREEN, KNOCKING Quill OUT-OF-
FRAME as Groot dances on, blissfully unaware.

Groot, smiling, dances onward, as DRAX, in the clutches of a 
giant tentacle, is SLAMMED NUMEROUS TIMES BESIDE HIM.  

Groot arrives at GAMORA, who is blasting at the OFF-SCREEN 
BEAST.  

GAMORA

Get out of the way, Groot! You’re 
going to get hurt!

Groot stops dancing.  He WAVES at her.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

Hi.

She AERO-JETS back into the fray.  

As Groot DANCES, Drax FALLS directly behind him. 

Groot FREEZES.

Drax stares at him a moment, suspicious. Groot stays frozen.  

Drax LEAVES, and Groot COMMENCES THE DANCE where he left off.

Groot sees an INSECT FLYING BY. 

Suddenly dancing is forgotten and GETTING THIS BUG is all-
important. He CHASES it. 

He HOPS up and grabs it from the air...

And starts EATING it.  

Rocket spots this and FLIES DOWN beside him, worried.  He 
PRIES OPEN GROOT’S MOUTH with his fingers, frantically trying 
to get it out.

ROCKET

Spit it out! Spit it out!

Groot COUGHS IT OUT. The bug FLIES crookedly away, one wing 
mulched.  

Rocket JETS OFF back toward the battle, muttering:

ROCKET (CONT’D)

Disgusting.

Groot sees something else and becomes furious. We follow his 
line of sight to a GRAZING ORLONI.  

Groot SCREAMS A WAR CRY and ATTACKS IT.  He GROWS HIS 
BRANCHES AROUND IT, and the terrified Orloni DARTS AWAY, 
DRAGGING GROOT WITH IT.  

Groot’s anger becomes panic as he is DRAGGED AROUND BY THE 
ORLONI and can’t let go.  

The Orloni DARTS around the power station and underneath the 
RAGING BATTLE, a CRYING Groot bouncing along behind it.  

Finally, he LETS GO and goes TUMBLING, ROLLING directly INTO 
THE CAMERA.

And then stands up and, as if none of it happened at all, 
starts DANCING AGAIN.

We PAN and see the speakers and Walkman beside him, and we 
realize Baby Groot has traveled around the entire Power 
Station and has arrived back where he started -

When Drax is FLUNG by the beast into the stereo system, 
SMASHING it.

Groot stops dancing. Angry that Drax has ruined his fun, he 
picks up a piece of the stereo and beats him with it.

CREDITS END.

Drax stands and glares at the ferocious beast as Rocket, 
Quill, and Gamora BLAST at it without effect. 

DRAX

The beast’s hide is too thick to be 
pierced from the outside. I must 
cut through it from the inside.

GAMORA

Huh?

Drax HOLLERS, CHARGING the creature.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

Drax, no! That doesn’t make -

The creature OPENS ITS ENORMOUS MOUTH, SCREECHING, and Drax 
LEAPS INSIDE IT, instantly swallowed up.

QUILL

What is he doing?!

GAMORA

He said the skin is too thick to be 
pierced from the outside, so he --

QUILL

That doesn’t make sense!

GAMORA

I tried to tell -- !

QUILL

Its skin is the same thickness from 
the inside as from the out!

GAMORA

I REALIZE THAT.

INT. BEAST’S STOMACH - DOESN’T MATTER

Drax HOLLERS as he SLASHES AWAY inside the goo of the beast’s 
stomach.  To no avail.

I/E. POWER STATION - DAY

Quill reloads his pistol, thinking.

QUILL

Gamora, there’s a cut on its neck - 
Rocket, get it to look up.

Quill and Rocket JET UP HIGH up over the creature as they 
BLAST REPEATEDLY at it.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Hey, you giant Sea Monkey, up here!

Gamora’s rifle is jammed.  She tosses it down.  PULLS HER 
SWORD.  SNAPS IT OPEN.

The beast SCREECHES at Quill and Rocket FLYING overhead.  The 
colorful SPLATTER MATTER FLIES FROM ITS MOUTH, BATTERING 
ROCKET, BURNING his clothes.  

But its neck is exposed, where the skin is thinner, and there 
is a small wound.

Gamora DASHES, LEAPING HIGH into the air, and she PLUNGES her 
sword directly into the wound. 

She holds tight to the hilt as she FALLS, SLICING AN INCISION 
down the length of the creature’s neck.

The beast WOBBLES, TOPPLES, and DIES.  As it COLLAPSES, Drax 
SPILLS OUT of the wound. He raises his arms in victory.

DRAX

Ha ha! I have single-handedly 
vanquished the beast!

Quill SCOFFS. Rocket SNORTS. Gamora stares at him, dead-eyed.  
Baby Groot throws a rock at him.

DRAX (CONT’D)

What?

I/E. POWER STATION - MOMENTS LATER

The Guardians de-rig by the Anulax batteries.  

DRAX

What are they called again?

QUILL

Anulax batteries.  

DRAX

Harbulary batteries.

QUILL

That’s nothing like what I just 
said. But they’re worth thousands 
of units a piece. Which is why the 
Sovereign hired us to protect them.  

Rocket pulls out one of the ANULAX BATTERIES, checking it 
out.

Gamora, Drax, and Quill walk on.  Rocket stays back a moment. 
Quill nods down the walkway, where GOLDEN SOVEREIGN CITIZENS 
stand at the edge of the station, gawking.  

QUILL (CONT’D)

Just be careful what you say around 
these folks. They’re easily 
offended and the cost of 
transgression is death.

DRAX

Sounds judgmental for a bunch of 
golden morons.

QUILL

That’s the kind of thing you might 
want to keep to yourself.

GAMORA

I’ll hold my tongue, as long as 
they deliver what was promised.

EXT. LAIR OF THE HIGH PRIESTESS - MORNING

An enormous golden palace in the shape of a globe, dappled by 
morning sunlight. 

AYESHA (O.S.)

We thank you, Guardians, for 
putting your life on the line. We 
could not risk the lives of our own 
Sovereign citizens. 

INT. LAIR OF THE HIGH PRIESTESS - DAY

HIGH PRIESTESS AYESHA is stunningly beautiful with golden 
skin.  Her CHAMBERMAIDS and other DENIZENS flutter throughout 
her luxurious lair, all of whom are equally perfect.  

AYESHA

Every citizen is born exactly as 
designed by the community, 
impeccable, both physically and 
mentally. We control the DNA of our 
progeny, germinating them in 
birthing pods. 

QUILL

I guess I prefer making people the 
old-fashioned way.

AYESHA

Well... perhaps someday you could 
give me a history lesson in the 
archaic ways of our ancestors... 
for academic purposes.

QUILL

Yeah, I mean, if it’s for research 
that could be pretty --

Quill sees Gamora staring at him.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Pretty repulsive. I’m not into that 
kind of casual -

GAMORA

Oh, please. 

(to Ayesha)

Your people promised something in 
trade for our services.  Bring it 
and we shall gladly be on our way.

Ayesha nods.  

Two SOLDIERS emerge with A WOMAN in a hood and cloak, her 
wrists bound by SHACKLES.  They SHOVE HER TO HER KNEES and 
yank back her hood, REVEALING --

NEBULA. Her clothes are tattered.  Her hand is now just a low-
tech metal claw.  

She glares at Gamora.  Gamora glares at her. Quill looks from 
one to the other, feeling the tension.

QUILL

(quietly)

Family reunion. Yaaaay.

AYESHA

I understand she is your sister?

Gamora roughly picks Nebula up, starts to go.  

GAMORA

She’s worth no more to me than the 
bounty due for her on Xandar.

AYESHA

Our soldiers apprehended her 
attempting to steal the batteries. 
Do with her as you please. 

QUILL

Thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

Quill starts to go.

AYESHA

What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

Quill turns back towards her, uncomfortable with the 
question.

QUILL

My mother is from earth.

AYESHA

And your father?

QUILL

He’s... not from Missouri, that’s 
all I know.

Ayesha stares at him as if she’s eaten something foul.

AYESHA

I see it within you, an unorthodox 
genealogy. A hybrid that seems 
particularly... reckless. 

Quill tries not to let this affect him, but it does. Rocket 
grins a huge, fake grin at Ayesha.

ROCKET

You know, they told me you people 
were conceited douchebags. But that 
isn’t true at all.

Rocket turns to Quill and WINKS.  The Guardians shift 
uncomfortably.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

Oh, shit, I’m using my wrong eye 
again, aren’t I?

(to Ayesha)

I’m sorry. That was meant to be 
behind your back.

Drax YANKS Rocket away.  

Gamora and Quill head out of the lair. Drax and Rocket are a 
few paces behind.

DRAX

Count yourself blessed they didn’t 
kill you.

ROCKET

You’re telling me. You wanna buy 
some batteries?

Rocket grins and shows Drax something hidden in his bag - TWO 
ANULAX BATTERIES.

“LAKE SHORE DRIVE” by ALIOTTA, HAYNES, AND JEREMIAH PLAYS. 

Drax LAUGHS. Rocket SHUSHES him so Quill and Gamora don’t 
hear.

EXT. SOVEREIGN SPACE DOCK/THE MILANO - MOMENTS LATER

The Milano RISES into the blue sunset over the Sovereign 
Space Dock filled with golden, capsule-shaped ships. 

Rocket works the controls as they rise up. He speaks into the 
comm:

ROCKET

Let’s get baldy back to Xandar and 
retrieve that bounty!

INT. MILANO LOWER FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Groot lies on the rear window peering out the back as they 
pass overhead. 

On the CASSETTE PLAYER AWESOME MIX VOL. 2 is playing; we PAN 
away from it, MOVING IN on Quill, looking perturbed as he 
takes off his jacket. 

Gamora is nearby, putting shackles on Nebula.

GAMORA

You all right?

QUILL

That stuff about my father. Who 
does she think she is?

GAMORA

I know you’re sensitive about that.

QUILL

I’m not sensitive about it. I just 
don’t know who he is. 

Gamora nods.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Sorry if it looked like I was 
flirting with her. I wasn’t.

GAMORA

I don’t care if you were.

Gamora pushes Nebula to the rear of the craft. 

QUILL

I think you do care. That’s why I’m 
apologizing. 

Quill watches her go, somewhat longingly. 

DRAX

Gamora is not the one for you, 
Quill.

Quill is startled to see Drax directly beside him.

DRAX (CONT’D)

There are two types of beings in 
the universe. Those who dance, and 
those who do not.  

QUILL

Uh huh.

DRAX

I first met my beloved at a war 
rally. 

(MORE)

Everyone in the village flailed 
about, dancing. Except one woman. 
My Ovette. I knew immediately she 
was the one. 

Quill nods, trying to be polite.

DRAX (CONT’D)

The most melodic song in the world 
could be playing, and she wouldn’t 
even tap her foot. She wouldn’t 
move a muscle. One might assume she 
was dead.

QUILL

Well, that is pretty hot, but--

DRAX

It would make my nether regions 
engorge -

QUILL

All right, okay, fascinating, don’t 
need to hear it.  I get your point, 
I’m a dancer and Gamora is not.

Drax smiles kindly, clutches Quill’s shoulder.

DRAX

You just need to find a woman who 
is pathetic, like you.

At the rear of the ship, Gamora roughly restrains Nebula. 
Nebula notices a bowl of fruit.

NEBULA

I am hungry. Hand me some of that 
yaro root. 

GAMORA

No. It’s not ripe yet. And I hate 
you.

NEBULA

You hate me?! You left me there 
while you stole that stone for 
yourself. Yet here you stand, a 
hero, a Garden of the Galaxy!

GAMORA

A what?

Nebula stares at her, confused.

DRAX (CONT'D)

GAMORA (CONT’D)

‘Guardians of the Galaxy.’

NEBULA

Oh.

GAMORA

Why would we be ‘the Gardens of the 
Galaxy’? 

NEBULA

I don’t know. I thought it was 
stupid. 

GAMORA

Yeah, it would be. 

NEBULA

It’s still wordy.

GAMORA

I wasn’t the one who thought of it.

NEBULA

Your name doesn’t matter. I’ll be 
free of these shackles soon enough, 
and I’ll kill you, I swear.

GAMORA

No. You’ll live out your days in a 
prison on Xandar, wishing you 
could.

WARNING LIGHTS FLASH.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - MOMENTS LATER

Gamora MOVES UP from the stairs. Rocket and Quill are in the 
pilot seats. Drax is moving up from the back.

QUILL

We got an armed Sovereign fleet, 
approaching from the rear.

Gamora takes the center seat, sees a REARVIEW SCAN: 

Golden, capsule-shaped, Sovereign OMNICRAFT, with a video 
screen on front and a blaster on each side - getting closer.

GAMORA

Why would they do that?!

DRAX

Probably because Rocket stole some 
of their batteries.

Quill and Gamora look at Rocket, astounded.  Rocket gawks at 
Drax, betrayed.

ROCKET

Dude.

DRAX

Oh, right.  He didn’t steal one of 
those. I don’t know why they’re 
after us. What a mystery this is.

THE SOVEREIGN FIRE UPON THE MILANO. 

Quill does his best to evade their blasts.

QUILL

What were you thinking?!

ROCKET

Dude, it was really easy to steal.

GAMORA

That’s your defense?

ROCKET

Come on. You saw how that high-
priestess talked down to us! I’m 
teaching her a lesson!

QUILL

Oh! I didn’t realize your 
motivation was altruism. A shame 
the Sovereign have mistaken your 
intentions and are trying to kill 
us.

ROCKET

Exactly.

QUILL

I WAS BEING SARCASTIC!

ROCKET

Oh no! You tricked me! You’re 
supposed to use a sarcastic voice!  
Now I look foolish!

Drax points at Rocket and LAUGHS at him.

QUILL

SHUT UP, DRAX! You knew! You should 
have told us!

Drax is aghast. He looks at Rocket.

DRAX

Did you tell him it was easy to 
steal?

ROCKET

Are you kidding me?

DRAX

What?

ROCKET

You never listen to anything!

GAMORA

None of you listens! Can we please 
just put the bickering on hold 
until after we survive the massive 
space battle?!

Rocket glances at Quill, nodding back at Gamora.

ROCKET

Whoa. Somebody woke up on the wrong 
side of the bed this morning.

QUILL

Do not try to bro down with me 
right now, dude.  I will fricking
punch you in your fricking face.

ROCKET

Real nice! Resorting to violence.

QUILL

More incoming!

MORE SHIP FLY AT THEM from the front.

ROCKET

GOOD! I WANT TO KILL SOME GUYS!

They twist and turn between the oncoming ships as ROCKET 
FIRES AT THEM, SCREAMING.  They EXPLODE. 

On the front of the Sovereign ships is the VIDEO IMAGE OF A 
PILOT.

SOVEREIGN PILOT (ON SHIP)

Bloody hell!

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

The same SOVEREIGN PILOT sits in a REMOTE POD. On a SCREEN in 
front of her we see ROCKET FIRING. 

The SHIP IS HIT and the SCREEN GOES STATIC. 

The Pilot SHOUTS in anger, like a kid who lost at a video 
game. 

High Priestess Ayesha surveys from a walkway above; ROWS OF 
PODS containing PILOTS, all flying their Omnicraft remotely.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK

GAMORA

You’re not killing anyone. Those 
ships are all remotely piloted.

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

A SOVEREIGN ADMIRAL is beside Ayesha.

AYESHA

What is the delay, Admiral?

ADMIRAL

High Priestess, if we destroy their 
craft, we risk destroying the 
batteries. They’re extraordinarily 
combustible and could, in turn, 
destroy the entire fleet.

AYESHA

We have thousands of batteries and 
thousands of ships. Our concern is 
their slight against our people. We 
hired them and they steal from us? 
It is heresy of the highest order. 

The Admiral speaks into his comm.

ADMIRAL

All command modules -

A FRIGHTENED SOVEREIGN PILOT, on the outskirts of the battle, 
hears the Admiral in his headset.

ADMIRAL (O.S.) (CONT’D)

Fire with the intent to kill.

A MEAN SOVEREIGN PILOT, FIRING at the Milano, smirks.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

THE MILANO’S WING IS STRUCK.  The EMERGENCY SYSTEMS FLASH ON. 

QUILL

What’s the closest habitable 
planet?

Gamora dances her fingers over the UNIVERSAL NEURAL 
TELEPORTATION NETWORK, clicking through “jump points” until 
she finds one.

GAMORA

It’s called Berhert.

QUILL

How many jumps?

GAMORA

Only one. But the access point is 
47 clicks away. And it’s through 
that Quantum Asteroid Field over 
there. 

Quill spots, to his side, a HUGE FIELD OF SMALL, GLOWING 
ASTEROIDS, SWIRLING IN RANDOM PATTERNS, DISAPPEARING OUT OF 
SPACE and EMERGING AGAIN a few feet or a few yards away.

Quill ZOOMS SIDEWAYS toward the field.

DRAX

Quill, to make it through that, 
you’d have to be the greatest pilot 
in the universe.

Quill smirks.

QUILL

Lucky for us -

ROCKET

I am.

Rocket FLIPS the pilot controls between them so that he’s the 
one piloting the ship.  Quill gapes at him.

The Milano DIVES into the QUANTUM ASTEROID FIELD, SWOOPING in 
and around the SWIRLING ATOMIZED STONES, barely missing them.  

The Sovereign ships FOLLOW. They are not pilots on par with 
Rocket, so most of the ships are immediately PELTED WITH 
STONES AND DESTROYED.

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

One after another the SOVEREIGN PILOTS screens go blank, and 
they FALL BACK, angry and upset.

PUSH IN on Ayesha, barely containing her fury.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Quill FLIPS the controls back, so he’s piloting again.

ROCKET

What are you doing?!

QUILL

I’ve been flying this rig since I 
was ten years old.

ROCKET

I was cybernetically engineered to 
pilot a spacecraft!

Rocket FLIPS the controls back to him.

QUILL

You were cybernetically engineered 
to be a douchebag.

Quill FLIPS the controls back to him.

GAMORA

Stop it!

ROCKET

Quill, later on tonight you’re 
gonna lay down in your bed and 
there’s gonna be something squishy 
in your pillowcase and you’re gonna
be, like, ‘what’s this?’ and it’s 
gonna be because I put a turd in 
there.

Rocket FLIPS the switch back.

QUILL

You put your turd in my bed, I 
shave you.

ROCKET

Oh it won’t be my turd, it will be 
Drax’s. 

Drax LAUGHS cheerfully. Gamora glances at him. He explains:

DRAX

I have famously huge turds.

GAMORA

We’re about to die, and this is 
what we’re discussing?

DRAX

They raise havoc with the pipes.  
That’s why I do all the plumbing. I 
take responsibility for my actions. 
Unlike some people...

Drax eyes baby Groot. 

QUILL

Groot, he’s right, you have to 
start aiming inside the box.

Groot looks ashamed. Quill FLIPS the controls back.

GAMORA

Stop it.

Rocket SWITCHES it back. Quill SWITCHES it back.

They’re nearing the end of the Asteroid Field when both go to 
switch it at the same time and --

WHAM! A LARGE ASTEROID SMASHES THROUGH the stern of the 
Milano.

I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE

A CHUNK OF THE REAR OF THE CRAFT DISAPPEARS.  

Nebula IS SUCKED toward the hole - but, fortunately, her arms 
are shackled to a post, so she doesn’t fly out. 

Her face and body cover with frost.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Everything FLIES AROUND THE SPACECRAFT, RUSHING THROUGH THE 
HOLE. 

Groot GOES FLYING, but Quill CATCHES HIM, and casually TOSSES 
him back to Drax --

So that he can punch in a code, causing -

I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE

A PROTECTIVE ENERGY SHIELD SLIDES UP in front of the hole. 
Nebula COLLAPSES to the floor. She yells upstairs --

NEBULA

Idiots!

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Everyone catches their breath, relieved.

ROCKET

Well, that’s what you get when 
Quill flies.

Gamora THROWS SOMETHING HARD at the back of Rocket’s head.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

Ow!

GAMORA

There’s still a Sovereign craft 
behind us!

The electronics FLICKER.

QUILL

Our weapons are down!

GAMORA

Twenty clicks to the jump.

The Mean Pilot BLASTS at them from the sole Sovereign Craft, 
TAKING OUT another part of a wing. The Milano is TREMBLING.

Drax starts climbing down into the living area.

QUILL

Where’s he going?

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

A group of pilots have gathered around the Mean Pilot, 
rooting him on, like kids at a video arcade.

FRIGHTENED PILOT

Come on, Zylak, you can do this.

I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE

Nebula sees the bowl of yaro root has spilled in front of 
her. 

She reaches for a piece, but it’s KICKED OUT OF HER WAY.  

She looks up to see Drax, grabbing a cable on a spool 
attached to the wall.

DRAX

It’s not ripe.

Drax HOOKS the cable to his belt. A folder on the wall reads 
SPACESUITS FOR EMERGENCY and, below that, in Rocket’s scrawl: 
OR FOR FUN.  

Drax pulls a small disk from the folder.  He slaps it between 
his shoulder blades and a SHIMMERY SHEATH COVERS HIS ENTIRE 
BODY - a thin force-field spacesuit.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Gamora watches THE MAP leading to the jump point.

GAMORA

Fifteen clicks.

Another BLAST from the Sovereign craft HITS them.  

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

The pilots rooting on the Mean Pilot erupt into CHEERS.

I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE

Drax grabs a huge rifle.  

He punches buttons on the wall. A SECOND PROTECTIVE SHIELD 
OPENS UP between him and Nebula, and THE FIRST PROTECTIVE 
SHEATH OPENS, exposing him to space --

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

The Mean Pilot watches in awe as Drax JUMPS OUT the back of 
the Milano.

I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE

Drax smiles. The cable UNSPOOLS and SNAPS TAUT when it 
reaches its end.  

Drax is DRAGGED HAPHAZARDLY by the Milano like a water sled 
on a boat.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

ON THE MAP, the jump point gets closer.

GAMORA

Ten clicks.

I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE

The Mean Pilot BLASTS WILDLY at Drax, missing him by mere 
inches.  

Drax brings the sight to his eye.  Aims at the ship.  

DRAX

Die, spaceship.

And he SHOOTS, BLASTING the Sovereign ship.

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

The Mean Pilot SCREAMS as his lights go out. The Frightened 
Pilot shakes his head in disgust.

FRIGHTENED PILOT

You suck, Zylak.

Zylak is really sad.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

As Quill and Rocket leave the asteroid field, it seems for a 
moment they’re scot-free... 

GAMORA

Five clicks!

Then DOZENS OF OMNICRAFT pull around them on both sides.

QUILL

Son-of-a-! They went around the 
field!

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

Ayesha smiles.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

It looks like the end of the road for the Guardians when -

THERE IS A BLINDING BURST OF LIGHT AND ALL OF THE OMNICRAFT
EXPLODE.

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

Ayesha watches in shock as the screens in the pods go dead.

ADMIRAL

Someone destroyed all the ships.

AYESHA

What?! WHO?!

But the Admiral doesn’t know.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Rocket sees the BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT is emanating from an OVAL-
SHAPED SPACECRAFT. 

ROCKET

What is that?!

Quill sees the FLICKERING framework of a JUMP POINT.

QUILL

Doesn’t matter! That’s the jump 
point! GO! GO! 

As they’re about to reach the jump point, Rocket sees a MAN 
standing casually atop the oval ship, LIGHT BURSTING THROUGH 
HIS BODY and into the craft - the source of the explosion.

ROCKET

It’s a guy.

Quill doesn’t see as the Milano DISAPPEARS INTO THE JUMP 
POINT.

I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA/DIRECTLY ABOVE BERHERT - DAY

The ship POPS IN HERE, TELEPORTING directly above the earth-
like planet. Because the ship is in such bad shape, parts of 
it TEAR OFF AND SPIRAL AWAY as it enters this new atmosphere.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Gamora sees Drax being dragged in the REARVIEW MONITOR.

GAMORA

Oh my God.

I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA/DIRECTLY ABOVE BERHERT - DAY

Drax WHIPS WILDLY OUT of the back of the ship.  The CABLE 
SPOOL on the wall is coming off - 

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK/BERHERT FOREST - DAY

Quill sees a green forest APPROACHING UNBELIEVABLY FAST.

He turns toward Gamora, but she’s gone.  Instead Baby Groot 
is sitting alone, happily munching on candies as if he’s 
watching a movie.

QUILL

Groot, put on your seat belt!

I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA/DIRECTLY ABOVE BERHERT - DAY

The SPOOL DETACHES and FLIES toward the back, which would 
leave Drax in the upper reaches of the planet’s atmosphere -

But Gamora has made it downstairs - she GRABS ONTO THE SPOOL 
with one hand while CLUTCHING onto a secure part of the ship 
with her other.  As it SNAPS TIGHT, it nearly wrenches her 
apart. She GROANS.

QUILL

Prepare for a really bad - 

The Milano HITS THE TREES, BARRELING OVER THEM.  They PART
and FLATTEN and SWAT at the windshield. 

Out back, Gamora HOLDS TIGHT despite searing pain, as Drax 
BOUNCES VIOLENTLY off the trees.

DRAX

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

And, eventually, the Milano comes to an ABRUPT STOP.

SUPER: BERHERT
       M20 22A4834126+306CA12

Drax pushes himself up in the dirt.  He CHUCKLES.  He glances 
back at Gamora like the madman he is.

DRAX (CONT’D)

That was awesome.

Gamora nods, sure, yeah, okay, whatever, dude.

I/E. CRASHED MILANO - CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER

CRANE DOWN OVER THE SMOKING, BATTERED MILANO TO our heroes, 
and a still-shackled Nebula.  

GAMORA

Either one of you could have gotten 
us through that field, if you had 
flown with what’s between your ears 
instead of what’s between your 
legs!

QUILL

If what’s between my legs had a 
hand on it, I guarantee I could 
have landed this ship. 

GAMORA

It’s not funny, Peter. We almost 
died. Because of your arrogance.

QUILL

(re: Rocket)

More like because he stoled Anulax
batteries! 

DRAX

They’re called Harbulary batteries.

QUILL

No, they’re not! 

ROCKET

You know why I did it, Star-Munch?

Quill fumes.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

Do you?

QUILL

I’m not going to answer to ‘Star-
Munch.’

ROCKET

I DID IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO.

QUILL

Dick.

ROCKET

What are we even talking about this 
for? We just had a little man save 
us by blowing up fifty ships!

DRAX

How little?

Rocket shows him with his finger and thumb.

ROCKET

Like this.

GAMORA

A little one-inch man saved us?

ROCKET

Well, if he got closer I’m sure 
he’d be much larger.

QUILL

That’s how eyes work, you stupid 
raccoon. 

ROCKET

Don’t call me a raccoon!

QUILL

Oh, I’m sorry, I meant to say 
‘trash panda.’

Rocket pauses, unsure, looks at Drax.

ROCKET

Is that better?

DRAX

I don’t know.

QUILL

It’s worse.

ROCKET

YOU SON-OF-A-!!

Rocket LEAPS, SNAPPING at Quill, when Nebula looks up into 
the sky.

NEBULA

Someone followed you through the 
jump point.

A HUGE SPACESHIP HOVERS overhead. 

The Guardians COCK THEIR WEAPONS as they FALL BACK-TO-BACK in 
tight formation.

NEBULA (CONT’D)

Set me free.  You’ll need my help.

GAMORA

I’m not a fool, Nebula.

NEBULA

You’re a fool if you deprive 
yourself a hand in combat.

GAMORA

You’ll attack me the moment I let 
you go.

NEBULA

(mumbly, unconvincing)

No, I won’t.

QUILL

You’d think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.

DRAX

I bet it’s the one-inch man!!

The SHIP LANDS, CRUSHING ALL OF THE TREES AROUND IT.  

A HATCH OPENS, and an adventurous, outer space frontiersman 
steps forward. He has grown hardened and haggard over the 
years, but he is definitely the MYSTERIOUS MAN from the 
beginning of the film.  MANTIS, a creepy woman with antennae, 
emerges behind him.  

The Man smiles.

MYSTERIOUS MAN

After all these years, I’ve found 
you.

QUILL

Who the hell are you?

MYSTERIOUS MAN

I figured my rugged good looks 
would make that obvious. My name’s 
Ego. And I’m your Dad, Peter. 

EXT. CONTRAXIA - OUTER SPACE

QUIET. A planet of mostly water and white icy patches of 
land, revolving around two overlapping suns.

SUPER: CONTRAXIA
       M15 5127512731+X1955KX

EXT. THE IRON LOTUS - DAY

SNOW FALLS GENTLY over this sleepy, pastel-colored town of 
wood and stone buildings.  

PUSH IN on the Iron Lotus, a robot brothel and saloon.  
ASSORTED RAVAGERS, including KRAGLIN, as well as some ROBOTIC 
COURTESANS, are drunk and GIGGLING, trying to catch 
snowflakes on their tongues. 

INT. IRON LOTUS SUITE - DAY

YONDU UDONTA is staring out the window as he puts on his 
pants.  He looks utterly disconnected and alone.  

Behind him are three ROBOT COURTESANS.  One pushes a button 
on her neck and she POWERS DOWN.

TULLK (O.S.)

Yondu! Come on down!

Yondu looks down at the street where an older Ravager, TULLK, 
drunkenly dances, waving for him to join.

INT. IRON LOTUS - MOMENTS LATER

Yondu exits his suite. Two bodyguards, BRAHL and HALF-NUT, 
salute and follow him as he descends the stairwell.  

At the bottom of the stairs a group of RAVAGERS in BLUE 
UNIFORMS LAUGH. A gruff, older warrior, STAKAR, and a man 
seemingly made of diamonds, MARTINEX are among them.

Yondu stops when he sees them. He’s struck. Stakar LAUGHS as 
he tells a story -

STAKAR

And I was like, Aleta, I love you, 
but you’re crazy now, you always 
been -  

Yondu approaches Stakar with trepidation.

YONDU

Stakar. 

Stakar is surprised to see him.

YONDU (CONT’D)

Been some time. I’d -

STAKAR

Seems like this establishment is 
the wrong kind of disreputable. 

The blue-coats turn and walk away. 

YONDU

Stakar...

Stakar glances at the PROPRIETOR as he passes her.

STAKAR

There are a hundred Ravager 
factions, Sneeper. You just lost 
the business of ninety-nine by 
serving one.

PROPRIETOR

Please, sir! Sir!

Yondu stands there for a moment, hurt, as they head out the 
door. 

But, little by little, his hurt turns to rage and he FOLLOWS.

EXT. IRON LOTUS - DAY

Yondu trots quickly toward Stakar and the others. 

YONDU

You all can go to hell! I don’t 
care what you think of me!

Stakar swirls toward him, furious.

STAKAR

Then why you following us for?!

YONDU

‘Cause you’ll listen to what I got 
to say! 

STAKAR

I don’t got to listen to nothing! 
You betrayed the code! Ravagers 
don’t deal in kids!

YONDU

I didn’t know what was going on - 

STAKAR

You didn’t know ‘cause you didn’t 
want to know, ‘cause it made you 
rich! 

YONDU

I demand a seat at the table! I 
wear the flames same as you!

STAKAR

You may dress like a Ravager but 
you won’t hear no Horns of Freedom 
when you die, boy, and the Colors 
of Ogord will not flash over your 
grave! 

(MORE)

You think I take some pleasure in 
exiling you, you’re wrong. You 
broke all our hearts.

Stakar and the others storm away.  Martinex stays a moment, 
staring at Yondu, and then moves on too.

Yondu is left alone, shaken as the WHITE SNOW FALLS GENTLY on 
his blue face. 

NEARBY, a MONSTROUS RAVAGER leans in toward Kraglin, Tullk, 
GEF THE RAVAGER, OBLO, and RETCH. As he eyes Yondu, he 
WHISPERS:

MONSTROUS RAVAGER

First Quill betrays us and Yondu 
just lets him go, scot-free. Now 
he’s getting all riled over 
nothing. We followed him ‘cause he 
was the one wasn’t afraid to do 
what needed to be done. Seems like 
he’s going soft.

KRAGLIN

If he’s so soft why you whispering 
for?

MONSTROUS RAVAGER

You know I’m right, Kraglin.

TULLK

You best watch what you say about 
the Cap’n, Tay -

RETCH

Who the hell is that?!

Tullk stops when he sees High Priestess Ayesha approaching 
beside them. The Chambermaids ROLL OUT a LONG BLUE CLOTH so 
she doesn’t touch unconsecrated ground. 

She STOPS at the carpet’s end. Does her best to force a 
smile.

AYESHA

Yondu Udonta, I have a proposition 
for you.

Yondu looks at her.

EGO (PRE-LAP)

When your mother passed away, I 
hired Yondu to pick you up. 

STAKAR (CONT'D)

EXT. CAMPFIRE/CRASHED MILANO - NIGHT

Quill sits around a campfire with Ego, Mantis and the others, 
eating. Ego indulges heartily.

EGO (CONT’D)

I would have done so myself, but I 
was in the midst of an outlandish 
adventure at the time, battling 
demonic forces to save this 
dimension or some such nonsense - I 
can’t quite recall, it all bleeds 
together after awhile. But instead 
of returning you, Yondu kept you. I 
have no clue as to why.

QUILL

Because I was a skinny kid who 
could squeeze into places adults 
couldn’t, making thieving easier. 

EGO

I’ve been trying to track you down 
ever since. 

DRAX

I thought Yondu was your father.

QUILL

What?

Drax stares at him.

QUILL (CONT’D)

We’ve been together all this time 
and you thought Yondu was my 
actual, blood relative?

DRAX

You look exactly alike.

ROCKET

One’s blue.

QUILL

He wasn’t my father. Yondu was the 
guy who abducted me.  He’d beat the 
crap out of me so I’d learn how to 
fight and he kept me in terror 
threatening to eat me.  

EGO

Eat you?!

QUILL

Yes.

EGO

That son-of-a-bitch. 

GAMORA

How’d you locate us now?

EGO

Even where I reside, out past the 
edge of what’s known, we’ve heard 
tell of the man they call Star-
Lord. 

He stands, handing his dish to Gamora.

EGO (CONT’D)

Say we head out that way now? Your 
associates are welcome, even that 
triangle-faced monkey there. 

Rocket, self-conscious, feels his nose.

EGO (CONT’D)

I promise you, it’s like no place 
you’ve ever seen. And there I can 
explain your very special heritage, 
and finally be the father I’ve 
always wanted to be.

(almost teary)

‘Scuse me. I gotta take a whizz.

Ego leaves.  Quill looks at Gamora. 

QUILL

Not buying it.

GAMORA

Peter, we need to take a walk.

EXT. CAMPFIRE/CRASHED MILANO - NIGHT

Ego is WHISTLING “BRANDY” and PEEING into the bushes. 

Mantis looks at Drax. She GRINS, or at least her best attempt 
at grinning. It’s kind of creepy.

MANTIS

I am Mantis.

DRAX

What are you doing?

MANTIS

Smiling. I hear it is the thing to 
do to make people like you.

DRAX

Not if you do it like that.

MANTIS

Oh. I was raised alone on Ego’s 
planet. I do not understand the 
intricacies of social interaction. 

She points at Rocket.

MANTIS (CONT’D)

Can I pet your puppy? It is 
adorable.

DRAX

(mischievous)

Yes...

She goes to pet Rocket: startled, he SWIRLS and SNAPS at her.

MANTIS

AHH!

She pulls back her hand. Drax LAUGHS, heartily.

DRAX

That’s called a practical joke!

She GIGGLES.

MANTIS

I liked it very much!

They both LAUGH together. Nebula shakes her head with 
disbelief. 

EXT. BESIDE CRASHED MILANO - MOMENTS LATER

Quill and Gamora enter this private spot; the campfire 
flickers through the trees beyond them.

QUILL

Give me a break! After all this 
time, and he just expects to be my 
Dad all of the sudden!

GAMORA

I hear you.

QUILL

I mean, this could be a trap - the 
Kree purists, the Ravagers, now the 
Sovereign - they all want us dead.

GAMORA

I know, but -

QUILL

But what?

GAMORA

What was that story you told me 
about Zardu Hasselfrau?

QUILL

Who?

GAMORA

The wonderful television-singer 
man. He had a magic boat.

QUILL

David Hasselhoff?

GAMORA

Right.

QUILL

He had a talking car, not a magic -

GAMORA

Why did it talk again?

QUILL

Just to be a good friend, I guess.

GAMORA

And as a child you carried his 
picture in your pocket, and you 
told the other children he was your 
father, but he was out of town --

QUILL

(embarrassed)

Shooting Knight Rider or touring 
with his band in Germany. Why are 
you bringing this up now? I was 
drunk when I told you that.

GAMORA

I love that story.

QUILL

I don’t. It’s just sad! I was so 
sad because I’d see the other kids 
off playing catch with their dads, 
and I wanted that, more than 
anything in the world. 

Gamora takes Quill’s hands in her own.

GAMORA

My point is, maybe this man is your 
Hasselhoff. I know it’s a long 
shot. But I lost my father as a 
child. I’d give anything...

Quill nods, grudgingly. 

GAMORA (CONT’D)

If he ends up being evil, we’ll 
just kill him.

Quill CHUCKLES.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

What’s funny?

I/E. CRASHED MILANO - SUNRISE

Inside the ship, “THE CHAIN” BY FLEETWOOD MAC PLAYS on the 
cassette player. Nebula is angry.

NEBULA

You’re leaving me with that fox?!

Rocket is SOLDERING the ship.  

GAMORA

He’s not a fox.

Gamora glances at Rocket as she grabs her outer-space-
adventurer version of luggage.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

Shoot her if she does anything 
suspicious. Or if you feel like it.

Rocket GRUNTS.  Gamora looks at a sad Baby Groot.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

It will just be a couple days.  
We’ll be back before Rocket’s 
finished fixing the ship.

Gamora steps out. Rocket sees Groot, who is ABOUT TO CRY as 
he watches them go.

Drax and Quill come from the back of the ship.

DRAX

What about your spool of songs?

QUILL

I have clones.

DRAX

What if the Sovereign come?

QUILL

There’s no way for them to know 
they’re here.

DRAX

I am uncertain about parting ways.

QUILL

You’re like an old woman.

DRAX

Because I am wise?

Quill turns to Rocket as Drax and Gamora head toward the 
ship. He starts to say something nice - perhaps something 
conciliatory but --

ROCKET

Hope daddy isn’t as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy. 

Quill just shakes his head and SNICKERS.

QUILL

So what’s your goal here? To get 
everyone to hate you? ‘Cause it’s 
working.

Quill turns back around with Gamora and Drax and walks away.

Rocket looks at the others leaving as THE SONG BECOMES SCORE: 
I can still hear you saying you will never break the chain.
Rocket watches them move away.  

IN SLOW-MOTION, Quill, Drax, and Gamora approach the oval 
ship.  The slit opens.  Ego, with Mantis, is waiting inside.

Ego smiles and CLASPS his hand on Quill as he enters.  

INT. EGOS SHIP. SUNRISE

Quill sits back against the wall, alone, nervous.  He looks 
across the way at a SLEEP CHAMBER, where Mantis helps Ego lie 
down on a slab.

She places her hand on his forehead with her hand: her 
antennae ALIGHT. And he drifts off to sleep.

Quill takes a small, folded piece of paper out of his pocket. 

It’s the PHOTO OF DAVID HASSELHOFF. 

He looks at it, then looks at Ego.  Quill’s eyes fill with 
cautious hope.  And the SONG ENDS.

EXT. BERHERT - MOMENTS LATER

Ego’s ship rises, blocking out the sun.

EXT. EGO’S SHIP - OUTER SPACE

The Orb moves through a rainbowish funnel of space and time; 
technology beyond what even the Guardians know.

INT. EGO’S SHIP - OUTER SPACE

Quill and Drax are drinking tea and LAUGHING with Mantis.

QUILL

Can I ask you a personal question?

MANTIS

Oh, no one has ever asked me a 
personal question! 

QUILL

The antennae, what are they for?

MANTIS

Their purpose?

Gamora ENTERS, pouring herself some tea.

DRAX

Yes, Quill and I have a bet.

QUILL

You’re not supposed to say that.

DRAX

I say that if you are about to go 
through a doorway that is too low, 
your antennae will feel this, and 
stop you from being decapitated.

QUILL

Just making clear - if it’s 
anything else - any other answer - 
I win?

Gamora smiles, warmed by the good-natured, by-now-familiar 
bickering between Quill and Drax.

MANTIS

They are not for feeling doorways.

DRAX

(bummed)

Damn. I just lost my entire life’s 
savings.

QUILL

Three pairs of pants.

MANTIS

I think they have something to do 
with my empathic abilities.

GAMORA

What are - ?

MANTIS

If I touch someone I can feel their 
feelings -

QUILL

You read minds?

MANTIS

No. Telepaths know thoughts. 
Empaths feel feelings. Emotions. 

She looks at Quill.  

MANTIS (CONT’D)

May I?

Quill doesn’t stop her. Mantis, cautiously, touches him.  Her 
hand quivers as his emotions shoot through her and her 
antennae ALIGHT. She is moved.

MANTIS (CONT’D)

You feel love.

QUILL

Yeah, I guess, yeah, I have sort of 
a general, unselfish love for 
everyone.

MANTIS

No, romantic, sexual love.

QUILL

No. No, I don’t.

Mantis nods at Gamora.

MANTIS

For her.

QUILL

No.

Gamora is embarrassed. Drax starts LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY.

DRAX

She just told everyone your 
deepest, darkest secret, Quill! 
HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

QUILL

What the hell, dude? That’s a total 
overreaction. 

Drax SLAPS HIS CHEST.

DRAX

DO ME! DO ME!

Mantis touches Drax. She grins brightly.

MANTIS

I have never felt such humor!

She starts GIGGLING and before long both she and Drax are 
LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY.

QUILL

You got to be kidding me.

Drax and Mantis both point at Quill, clutching onto each 
other and FALLING OVER WITH LAUGHTER. Quill’s humiliated.

QUILL (CONT’D)

That’s so incredibly uncool.

Mantis wipes the tears from her eyes, composing herself.  She 
goes to touch Gamora, who grabs her wrist though her clothes.

GAMORA

Touch me. And the only thing you’re 
going to feel is a broken jaw.

Mantis smiles, nods, backs away.

MANTIS

I can also alter emotions, to some 
extent.  

QUILL

Like what?

MANTIS

If I touch someone who is sad I can 
ease them into contentment, for a 
short while. I can make a stubborn 
person compliant. But I mostly use 
it to help my Master sleep. He lies 
awake at night, thinking about his 
progeny.

Quill looks at her, struck by this.

DRAX

Do one of those on me!

Mantis touches him.  He grins expectantly.

MANTIS

Sleep.

Drax COLLAPSES, INSTANTLY ASLEEP. Mantis smiles at the 
others, hoping she has pleased. Quill and Gamora look at 
Drax, SNORING. They’re surprised.

GAMORA

Is that real?

QUILL

It’s kind of like someone put a 
baby’s head on a big, muscular 
body, isn’t it?

FADE TO BLACK.

O.S. ALIEN INSECTS CHIRP

EXT. CRASHED MILANO - NIGHT

Four moons shine over the forest. The campfire CRACKLES
beside the Milano, and “SOUTHERN NIGHTS” BY GLENN CAMPBELL
emerges from the cassette player within.

The Monstrous Ravager and Kraglin lead a group of Ravagers up 
over a ravine.  Dozens of M-Ships quietly lower behind them.  
Kraglin nods toward the sounds of Glenn Campbell in the 
distance.  They raise their weapons.

OVERHEAD SHOT: dozens and dozens of Ravagers come from 
different directions, surrounding the Milano.

One Ravager cluster, lead by Half-Nut, CREEPS close enough to 
the Milano that they see the lights within the vehicle and 
can hear Rocket inside HUMMING along to the song.

Half-Nut licks his lips in anticipation, closing in for the 
kill, when he steps on a small pedal.  It CLICKS.  

A HUNDRED DARTS FLY AT THE GROUP from traps set in trees.  
They STICK INTO THE RAVAGERS’ BODIES, knocking them instantly 
unconscious. As one Ravager FALLS, a GUNSHOT is discharged.

INT. CRASHED MILANO - NIGHT

Nebula is awakened by the SHOT.  She sees a frightened Groot, 
peering through a hole at the bodies falling. 

PULL BACK TO REVEAL, beside him, a futuristic walkie-talkie 
with ROCKET’S HUMS emerging.

EXT. CRASHED MILANO - PERCUSSIVE BOMB TRAP - NIGHT

Rocket is crouched on a limb in shadows above the Milano, 
smiling and HUMMING to “Southern Nights” into his comm. 

He spots A LARGER GROUP OF RAVAGERS APPROACHING THE MILANO
from the other side, led by Retch. 

Rocket LEAPS TOWARD THEM, from one tree limb to another like 
a squirrel.

The GROUP enters a clearing close to the ship. A TALL RAVAGER 
looks up and spots Rocket LEAPING OVER THEIR HEADS.

TALL RAVAGER

There!

The Ravagers BLAST at Rocket, following him. He HOPS from 
tree to tree as BULLETS WHIZZ PAST HIM, leading them right 
where he wants them. 

He stops in a tree at the end of the run.  He holds a device 
with two buttons. He presses one of them.

A PERCUSSIVE BOMB at the feet of the Ravagers BURSTS, sending 
half of them FLYING UP into the air.  

As the confused group on the ground watches, Rocket presses 
the second button and a second BOMB BURSTS.  They FLY UP INTO 
THE AIR as well.

Rocket SNICKERS, as he continues pushes the buttons and the 
two groups of Ravagers FLY UP and DOWN until the bombs are 
depleted of energy.

Retch looks up from the ground, to see the little animal 
hopping away in the tree limbs overhead.

EXT. CRASHED MILANO - STICKY DISK TRAP - NIGHT

An EVEN LARGER GROUP OF RAVAGERS walk beneath the branches, 
MOONLIGHT FLICKERING ON THEIR FACES.  

TILT UP TO REVEAL ROCKET’S SILHOUETTE on a gnarled limb. He’s 
clutching an armful of small discs.  He breathes shallowly, 
waits.  As soon as the last Ravager is passing beneath him, 
he LEAPS onto his back. 

Rocket JUMPS FORWARD FROM ONE MAN TO THE NEXT, SLAPPING A 
STICKY-DISC to each of their heads - SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP!

And then he LEAPS from the Ravager at the front of the line 
BACK UP INTO THE TREES.  

The men are confused.  They bring their fingers to the sticky 
discs on their bodies.

Rocket smiles in the tree as he flicks a trigger.  The STICKY-
DISCS SEND ELECTRICITY COURSING THROUGH ALL OF THE MEN’S 
BODIES. 

They CONVULSE for a moment, then COLLAPSE.

EXT. CRASHED MILANO - CLEARING - NIGHT

Rocket LEAPS to the ground in a crouch.  He sees Brahl
approaching in front of him, and then another RAVAGER 
approaching from behind.  They train their weapons on him.

BRAHL

Ain’t so tough now without all your 
toys, are you?

Rocket LEAPS up onto Brahl’s face. 

He PUNCHES HIM IN THE THORAX so hard he can’t breathe.  

The other Ravager SHOOTS at him, but Rocket BACKFLIPS over 
the SHOT so Brahl is STRUCK instead.

Rocket LANDS on the back of the shooter’s neck and RAPID-FIRE 
PUNCHES HIM in the head, until the man CRUMPLES to the 
ground, unconscious. 

As Rocket lands, he HEARS WHISTLING and he looks up to see -- 

YONDU’S ARROW FLYING THROUGH THE TREES, DIRECTLY TOWARD HIM.

ROCKET

Crap.

Another high-pitched WHISTLE and the arrow STOPS ABRUPTLY, 
FLOATING with the tip almost grazing Rocket’s forehead. 

Yondu waltzes out of the trees with Tullk, Kraglin, the 
Monstrous Ravager, and many more.  

Rocket reluctantly raises his hands in surrender.  

YONDU

Hey there, rat.

ROCKET

How’s it going, you blue idiot?

YONDU

Eh, not so bad. We got a pretty 
good gig. A golden gal with quite a 
high opinion of herself offered us 
a large sum to deliver you and your 
pals to her, so she can kill y’all.

INT. CRASHED MILANO - NIGHT

Nebula looks out the window to see even more Ravagers 
surrounding Rocket.  She looks at baby Groot.

NEBULA

Your friend. There’s too many of 
them. They’re going to kill him.

Groot looks as if he’s about to cry.

NEBULA (CONT’D)

He needs my help. If you care about 
him, you need to get me out of 
these bonds.

Groot is unsure.

EXT. CRASHED MILANO - CLEARING - NIGHT

The Ravagers have entirely encircled Rocket.  There’s no 
chance of escape.  Though upset, he mostly holds it in.

YONDU

Pretty easy to find you, since we 
put a tracer on your ship back 
during the War over Xandar.

ROCKET

You give me your word you won’t 
hurt Groot, and I’ll tell you where 
the batteries are.

YONDU

Lucky for you my word don’t mean 
squat. Otherwise I’d actually hand 
you over.

MONSTROUS RAVAGER

Otherwise you’d what?!

Yondu scowls at the Monstrous Ravager.

YONDU

We’ll take the batteries. They’re 
worth a a quarter mil on the open 
market -

MONSTROUS RAVAGER

That priestess offered us a 
million! A quarter is only one 
third of that!

YONDU

A quarter ain’t one-th - 

OBLO

A quarter is four times a million! 
We’re in the money!

GEF THE RAVAGER

No, idiot. A quarter is twenty-
five. 

YONDU

No -

GEF THE RAVAGER

We can’t even buy a pair of boots 
with twenty-five units!

YONDU

The point is, we aren’t stupid 
enough to help kill the Guardians 
of the Galaxy. We’d have the whole 
Nova Corps on us.  

KRAGLIN

(realizing)

That ain’t right. I just gotta say 
it this one time, Cap’n.

Everyone looks at Kraglin.

KRAGLIN (CONT’D)

No matter how many times Quill 
betrays you, you protect him, like 
none of the rest of us much matter. 
I’m the one what sticks up for you, 
me and Tullk. 

MONSTROUS RAVAGER

Damn straight, lad. You’re right: 
he’s going soft. S’pose it’s time 
for a change in leadership!

KRAGLIN

Uh -

The Monstrous Ravager points his weapon at Yondu.  

Others follow his lead. 

A handful of others, including Tullk and the Innocent 
Ravager, raise their weapons in their Captain’s defense, so 
that the whole circle are aiming at one another. Kraglin is 
confused.

TULLK

Put you damn guns down! 

Rocket is in the center of the potential crossfire.  

ROCKET

Hold on! There’s got to be some 
sort of peaceful resolution here! 
Or even a violent resolution, where 
I’m standing over there.

Yondu glares at the Monstrous Ravager.  His FIN LIGHTS UP and 
he starts to WHISTLE when -

A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT; THE FIN IS BLOWN OFF THE TOP OF YONDU’S 
HEAD.  The arrow CLATTERS to the ground.

Rocket watches as Yondu, confused, TOTTERS there for a 
moment, and then COLLAPSES -- 

REVEALING NEBULA behind him, clutching a smoking pistol. 
Rocket looks at her, dead-eyed: really?

She SHOOTS HIM WITH A BLAST OF ELECTRICITY, knocking him 
unconscious.  

The Ravagers gape at Nebula.

NEBULA

Well, hello, boys.  

She takes a bite from a piece of yaro root she stole from the 
Milano. As she chews, she becomes disgusted. 

She spits it out.

NEBULA (CONT’D)

It’s not ripe.

EXT. RED PLANET - MOMENTS LATER

Ego’s ship ARRIVES at a bold red planet, twisting in front of 
an enormous yellow sun, so close it seems like the sun is 
about to devour it. “MY SWEET LORD” BY GEORGE HARRISON PLAYS.

SUPER: EGO’S PLANET
       G52 22C848T12F+E16UC22

INT. EGO’S SHIP - SLEEP CHAMBER - OUTER SPACE

Mantis sets her hand on Ego’s forehead, waking him.

EXT. EGO’S PLANET/SPACEPORT - MOMENTS LATER

Ego’s ship lands in a spaceport.  It organically JOINS the 
spot where it lands - strands of material actually linking up 
with the landing pad itself.

From the front of the craft, a FLOATING TRAM emerges, with 
Ego, Mantis, Quill, Gamora, and Drax.  

As the TRAM GLIDES toward its destination, the Guardians are 
overwhelmed by transcendentally splendid surroundings. The 
plant life is colorful and alien.  Tall, twisting obelisks 
seem to have no function other than beauty itself.

EGO

Welcome, friends, to my world.

QUILL

Wow. You have your own planet?
EGO

But a trifle, no larger than your 
earth’s moon.

DRAX

Humility. I like it. I too, am 
extraordinarily humble. 

Even Gamora smiles at the wonder of it all.  

Multicolored mercurial clumps FLOAT BY.  

Drax pokes one, and it BURSTS INTO A DOZEN VIBRANT HUES. 

EXT. TRAM/PALACE - MOMENTS LATER

Ahead of them looms an astounding palace atop a mountain.

QUILL

It’s beautiful.

The tram STOPS. 

They step off it and toward the palace, Ego stops beside a 
large FOUNTAIN.

EGO

Peter, consider this a token of a 
father’s pride. 

Ego motions; the WATERS OF THE FOUNTAIN FALL AWAY, REVEALING 
a GIANT STATUE OF STAR-LORD: Quill stands heroically, with 
foolish-looking Guardians kneeling around him worshipfully.

EGO (CONT’D)

A memorial to the War Over Xandar, 
when you single-handedly saved the 
galaxy.

GAMORA

Single-handedly?

QUILL

Whoa. It’s perfect.

GAMORA

You’ve got to be kidding.

DRAX

Why am I dead? Why did you all kill 
me?!

GAMORA

That’s Ronan. That’s you.

Drax is sitting on Quill’s shoulder, with a raccoon tail.

DRAX

When was I that tiny?

Gamora shakes her head in disbelief. They step past the 
statue and onto the steps approaching the palace.

GAMORA

You own a planet and can destroy 
two dozen spaceships without a 
suit. What are you, exactly?

EGO

I’m what they call a Celestial, 
sweetheart.  

The Guardians STOP behind him, astounded.

QUILL

A Celestial. Like a... god?

EGO

Small ‘g’, son. At least on the 
days I’m feeling humble as Drax.

He LAUGHS and walks up the stairs.  

INT. PALACE - MOMENTS LATER

Ego SAUNTERS with Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis, through 
the enormous open doors, toward huge DIORAMAS lining either 
side of the palace, like cosmic Stations of the Cross. 

EGO

This form you see before you is 
only an extension of who I truly 
am. I don’t know where I came from, 
exactly.

The DIORAMAS around them begin to ANIMATE: In the first, a 
FLICKERING BRAIN COMPOSED OF POLYCHROMATIC LIGHT FLOATS in 
space. 

EGO (CONT’D)

The first thing I remember is 
flickering, adrift in the cosmos - 
utterly and entirely alone.

The flickering brain pulls cosmic dust and rocks into itself, 
ingesting them, GROWING. 

EGO (CONT’D)

I fed on the matter around me like 
plankton. I grew smarter and 
stronger.   

A hard metal shell forms around the brain, with channels 
running through for his energy to flow like rivers.  

EGO (CONT’D)

I formed a sheathe to protect 
myself from the elements.

Ego continues developing outward from the shell, growing the 
planet, then its beautiful landscapes and structures.

EGO (CONT’D)

And continued building from there, 
layer by layer, the very planet you 
walk on now. I built the spires 
reaching up to the sky and the 
tunnels burrowing into its depths.

QUILL

Wow.

EGO

But I was no ant to be fulfilled 
solely by labor. I wanted more. I 
desired... meaning.

In the core shell - the Self Chamber - the flickering brain 
floats, alone, perhaps sad.

EGO (CONT’D)

There must be some life out there 
in the universe besides just me, I 
thought, and I set myself to task 
with finding it. 

The brain grows a SKELETAL FRAMEWORK OF LIGHT up from the 
self chamber and to the surface of the planet.  He pulls 
molecules around this shape to create his “human” self.  

EGO (CONT’D)

I created what I imagined 
biological life might be like, down 
to the most minute detail.

DRAX

Did you make a penis?

QUILL

Dude.

DRAX

If he’s a planet, how did he make a 
baby with your mother? He would 
smush her.

QUILL

I don’t need to hear about how my 
parents, you know -

DRAX

Why? My father would tell me the 
story of impregnating my mother 
every winter solstice. 

QUILL

That’s disgusting.

DRAX

It was beautiful. You earthers have 
hang-ups.

EGO

Yes, Drax, I’ve got a penis. 

QUILL

Oh my God.

EGO

It’s not half bad. I’ve also got 
pain receptors, a digestive system, 
and all the accompanying junk. I 
wanted to experience what it truly 
meant to be human as I set out 
amongst the stars. 

In another DIORAMA, Ego explores various uninhabited and 
barren planets.  

EGO (CONT’D)

I visited thousands of planets over 
thousands of years, one barren husk 
after the next until I found what I 
sought... 

Ego stares down at a CUTE ALIEN CHILD.

EGO (CONT’D)

Life. I was not alone in this 
universe after all.

Ego reminisces: wistful? Sad? It’s hard to tell. 

QUILL

When did you meet my mother?

EGO

Not long after. 

Ego turns toward the last set of DIORAMAS. They show Meredith 
and Ego kissing and Ego with his hand on Meredith’s pregnant 
belly. 

EGO (CONT’D)

It was with Meredith that I 
experienced love for the first 
time. I called her my river lily. 
And from that love, Peter, you. 

In the final DIORAMA we PUSH IN on the belly and see, inside 
the womb, VERY young Peter Quill, a fetus, himself encased in 
light. 

Quill looks up in amazement - this story is the story of 
himself. And Ego gazes at Quill with adoration.  

EGO (CONT’D)

I searched for you for so long. 
When I heard a man from earth held 
an Infinity Stone in his hand 
without dying, I knew you must be 
the son of the woman I loved.

Ego puts his hand on Quill. Quill wants to believe, but he 
can’t quite let it go. 

QUILL

If you loved her why did you leave 
her?

EXT. THE ECLECTOR - OUTER SPACE

The Ravagers’ massive ship FLOATS in space.

SUPER: RAVAGER TERRITORY
       HE2 6SM6R16617+6241023

TULLK (O.S.)

You can’t do this!

INT. ECLECTOR CENTRAL AREA - OUTER SPACE

Ravagers LAUGH as they DRAG Tullk across the floor while he 
STRUGGLES to get free.

TULLK

This is mutiny! Mutiny!

They shove Tullk into a cylindrical room as a glass door 
CLOSES on him.  

He continues SCREAMING and SLAMMING ON THE GLASS, but we can 
barely hear him. 

Half-Nut smiles and presses a button. The outside of the 
compartment OPENS so that Tullk is SUCKED INTO SPACE. 

EXT. THE ECLECTOR - OUTER SPACE

Tullk FLOATS AWAY, opening his mouth to scream, but he can’t.  
His FACE AND BODY SWELL QUICKLY and he EXPIRES there.  

As we CURL AROUND his lifeless body, we REVEAL the countless 
other CORPSES of Ravagers loyal to Yondu, leading like bread 
crumbs toward nothing at all.

INT. ECLECTOR CENTRAL AREA - OUTER SPACE

Yondu watches this, helplessly.  He’s in a chair, his hands 
tied behind him. He’s a wreck, his headpiece destroyed, wires 
hanging from a gap in his head where the fin used to be.  He 
sees the mutineers grab the innocent Oblo, DRAGGING HIM to 
the same fate as Tullk.

OBLO

Cap’n, help me! Cap’n?!

Yondu drops his head in shame. 

MONSTROUS RAVAGER

You’re the one what kilt those men 
by leading ‘em down the wrong path.

He PUNCHES Yondu.

MONSTROUS RAVAGER (CONT’D)

Because you’re weak.

He PUNCHES him again.

MONSTROUS RAVAGER (CONT’D)

And stupid.

The Monstrous Ravager turns towards the Ravagers, who listen, 
rapt and vengeful. Nebula leans calmly against a wall, 
watching.  Kraglin watches too, seemingly concerned.  

MONSTROUS RAVAGER (CONT’D)

It’s time for the Ravagers to once 
again rise to glory with a new 
Cap’n... TASERFACE.

The Ravagers SHOUT IN APPROVAL. Taserface throws his arms up 
in glory - when he hears SNICKERING.  He stops.  

He and the other Ravagers turn and see Rocket, also in a 
chair with his arms secured behind him, GIGGLING.

ROCKET

I’m sorry.  Your name is... it’s 
‘Taserface’?

TASERFACE

That’s right.

ROCKET

Do you... shoot tasers out of your 
face?

TASERFACE

It’s metaphorical!

ROCKET

For what?

Taserface thinks. Time for a new answer:

TASERFACE

It’s a name what strikes fear in 
anyone what hears it!

ROCKET

(doubtful)

Really?... Okay, sure.

Taserface screams at him, SPIT FLYING EVERYWHERE.

TASERFACE

You shut up! You’re next!

Taserface goes back to Yondu, bringing out his blade.

TASERFACE (CONT’D)

Udonta, I been waiting to do this 
for a long ti -

Again they hear SNICKERING.  Rocket is burying his mouth in 
his chest, TRYING TO STOP FROM CRACKING UP.

TASERFACE (CONT’D)

What?! What?!

ROCKET

I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I just 
keep imagining you waking up one 
morning, looking in the mirror, 
and, in all seriousness, saying 
‘You know what would be a really 
kickass name? Taserface!’

Nebula smirks. The Ravagers are TRYING NOT TO LAUGH. Rocket 
can’t stop LAUGHING.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

What was your second choice?! 
Scrotum Hat?!

The Ravagers all BUST OUT LAUGHING.

TASERFACE

New plan. We’re killing you first.

Taserface SHOVES HIM BACK, ready to plunge the knife in him.  
Rocket’s smile disappears. He stares at Taserface with dead 
eyes.

ROCKET

Well, dying is certainly better 
than having to live an entire life 
as a moronic shitbag who thinks 
‘Taserface’ is a cool name.

Taserface goes to stab him, when -

NEBULA

That’s enough killing for today.

Taserface turns toward her, irritated.

TASERFACE

Thought you were the biggest sadist 
in the galaxy.

NEBULA

That was when Daddy was paying my 
bills. The Priestess wants to kill 
the fox herself. And he -

(re: Yondu)

- has bounties on his head in at 
least twelve Kree provinces. 

Taserface glares at her. It’s obvious he’s considering 
attacking her.

NEBULA (CONT’D)

I assure you, I am not as easy a 
mark as an old man without his 
magic stick or a talking woodland 
beast.

Taserface decides not to risk it.  

NEBULA (CONT’D)

I want ten percent of the take, and 
a couple more things.

INT. ECLECTOR DOCKING BAY HALL - LATER

Nebula is TRYING OUT A BRAND NEW HAND as Kraglin leads her 
through this hall.

KRAGLIN

We got a whole box of hands if that 
one don’t work out.

NEBULA

It’s fine.

KRAGLIN

You think them Kree is gonna
execute the Cap’n?

NEBULA

The Kree consider themselves 
merciful. It will be painless.

Kraglin comes to an open doorway beside a huge DOCKING BAY, 
and an M-SHIP decked out with lots of weapons.

KRAGLIN

Well, there it is, best ship we 
got. The location of Ego’s planet’s 
in the nav. We’ll wire you the ten 
percent when we’s paid. What you 
gonna do with your share?

Nebula stops at the doorway.

NEBULA

As a child my father would have 
Gamora and me battle one another in 
‘training.’ Every time my sister 
prevailed my father would replace a 
piece of me with machinery, 
claiming he wanted me to be her 
equal. But she won, again and again 
and again.  Never once refraining. 
Because of them, I am this.  So 
after I murder my sister, I will 
buy a warship with every 
conceivable instrument of death. 

(MORE)

I will hunt my father like a dog 
and I will tear him apart slowly, 
piece by piece, until he knows some 
semblance of the profound and 
unceasing pain I know every single 
day.

Kraglin stares at her, weirded-out.

KRAGLIN

Yeah... I was talking about, like, 
a pretty necklace. Or a nice hat. 
Something that’ll make the other 
girls go ‘oooooo, that’s nice.’

Nebula gives him a look of pure death. 

KRAGLIN (CONT’D)

Anyway, uh, happy trails.

INT. PALACE COURTYARD - DAY

Quill looks up at a GIANT SCULPTURE of his mother. He is 
upset. Ego is behind him, watching him, sadly.

QUILL

My mother told everyone my father 
was from the stars. 

Quill turns to look at his father, somewhat accusatory.

QUILL (CONT’D)

She had brain cancer - so everyone 
thought she was delusional. 

Ego looks sad, ashamed. 

EGO

Peter - 

QUILL

Listen. I’d love to believe all of 
this, I really would - but you left 
the most wonderful woman ever, to 
die alone! 

Ego has tears in his eyes.

EGO

I didn’t want to leave your mother, 
Peter. But if I don’t return 
regularly to this planet, and the 
light within, this form will wither 
and perish -- 

NEBULA (CONT'D)

QUILL

So why didn’t you come back?! Why’d
you send Yondu, a criminal, of all 
people, to fetch me?!

EGO

I loved your mother, Peter! I 
couldn’t stand to set foot on an 
earth where she wasn’t living! You 
can’t imagine what that’s like!

QUILL

I know exactly what that’s like! I 
had to watch her die!

Ego stops, seeming to hear his son.  He touches him.

EGO

Over the millions and millions of 
years of my existence I have made 
many mistakes, Peter. But you’re 
not one of them.  Please give me 
the chance to be the father she 
would want me to be.

Quill looks at him, vulnerable.

EGO (CONT’D)

There are so many things I need to 
teach you. This planet, and the 
light within... they are a part of 
you.

QUILL

What do you mean?

Ego takes Quill’s hands in his own, gently, putting them in 
the correct position.

EGO

Give me your hands, son.  Here. 
Hold them like that.

Quill holds his hands apart.  Ego steps back, holding his 
hands in the same way.

EGO (CONT’D)

Now close your eyes and 
concentrate. Take your brain to the 
center of the planet.

Quill concentrates. He holds his hand out.  A white light 
emanates from it.

EGO (CONT’D)

Yes! Yes!

QUILL

Whoa.

The light disappears as quickly as it came.

EGO

Yes, yes - it’s okay. Just relax. 
Concentrate. You can do it. Bring 
it back. 

Quill concentrates and the LIGHT, once again, bursts up from 
the palms of his hands.

EGO (CONT’D)

Yes, yes, now - shape it -

Ego shows him, pulling in the molecules around him, so that 
the light itself forms into the shape of a ball.

EGO (CONT’D)

Feel the energy.

Quill tries to pull molecules into the ball. And, little by 
little, they come, and the ball glows brighter. 

EGO (CONT’D)

Yes.

Quill laughs. Ego is JOYOUS. He almost looks as if he’s going 
to break down in tears.

EGO (CONT’D)

You’re home, Peter.

Ego cups his hands.

EGO (CONT’D)

Here.

Quill, smiling, THROWS him the ball. Ego LAUGHS. He inspects 
the cosmic ball of light, and he throws it back to Quill.

Quill LAUGHS, catching it, and throws it back.  Ego moves 
back further.  

And Ego and Quill continue tossing the ball back and forth 
there, LAUGHING, a friendly father and son game of catch in 
the middle of a palace courtyard. 

EXT. PALACE - DAY

Drax and Mantis sit here, soaking in the sun and gazing at 
the lush, flowing hills, like something an alien Maxfield
Parrish would paint. 

DRAX

How did you get here?

MANTIS

Ego found me in my larva state, 
orphaned on my homeworld. He raised 
me by hand, and kept me as his own.

DRAX

So you’re a pet?

MANTIS

I suppose.

DRAX

People usually want cute pets. Why 
would Ego want a hideous one?

MANTIS

I am hideous?

DRAX

You’re horrifying to look at, yes.

Mantis seems sad about this.  Drax notice this, feels bad.

DRAX (CONT’D)

But it is a good thing. 

MANTIS

Oh?

DRAX

When you are ugly and someone loves 
you, you know they love you for who 
you are.  Beautiful people never 
know who to trust.

MANTIS

Well, then I am certainly grateful 
to be ugly! 

(thinking)

Poor Gamora. She can never trust 
anyone.

Drax nods and stares out at spattered patches of water.

DRAX

Those pools remind me of a time I 
took my daughter to visit the 
Forgotten Lakes on my homeworld. 
She was like you.

MANTIS

Disgusting?

DRAX

Innocent.

Drax stares out at them without expression.  

Slowly, Mantis TOUCHES his shoulder. 

And, as she does, TEARS INSTANTLY FLOW DOWN HER CHEEKS. She 
stares with Drax at the hills.  They feel the sadness 
together: she cries while he’s stoic.

MANTIS

I have never met anyone like you, 
or your friends. You are filled 
with such... love.  It is a thing I 
did not know existed, not like 
this, and I think... I think it may 
be the very finest of all things.  
It both hurts and soothes the 
heart.

She looks at Drax. There is something she wants to say, but 
she is torn. 

MANTIS (CONT’D)

Drax, there is something I must 
tell -

GAMORA (O.S.)

What’s going on?

Drax and Mantis turn to see her behind them. She smiles.

MANTIS

I am learning many things. Like I 
am a pet and ugly.

GAMORA

You’re not ugly. 

(admonishing)

Drax.

Drax, confused, points at Mantis, as if her ugliness proves 
itself.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

Mantis, can you show us where we’ll 
be staying? I’m getting eye-strain 
in this place.

Mantis nods, yes.

EXT. PATH TO SLEEPING QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

Gamora, Drax, and Mantis walk across the sunset.  

GAMORA

Why are there no other beings on 
this planet?

MANTIS

The planet IS Ego. A dog would not 
invite a flea to live on his back. 

GAMORA

And you’re not a flea?

MANTIS

I’m a flea with a purpose. I help 
him sleep.

Gamora curls around Mantis, cutting her off.

GAMORA

What were you about to say to Drax 
before I walked out?

Mantis looks around, worried.

MANTIS

Nothing.

Gamora and Drax share a look: why is she so scared? Mantis 
moves on. 

MANTIS (CONT’D)

Your quarters are this way. 

INT. ECLECTOR CELL - OUTER SPACE

Rocket HITS THE GROUND, hard.  Yondu LANDS equally hard on 
the ground beside him.  

They look up to see Taserface, Gef the Ravager and an OBTUSE 
RAVAGER locking the cell door.

TASERFACE

We’ll deliver you to the Kree in 
the morning. Neither one of you 
gonna last much longer after that.

Rocket crawls toward them as they walk away.

ROCKET

Okay, Taserface. See you later, 
Taserface. Hey, Taserface, tell the 
other guys we said hi, Taserface!

Taserface glances back, perturbed, as he disappears around 
the corner. 

INT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE

Taserface, Gef, and Obtuse come around the hall.

GEF THE RAVAGER

What about the little plant? Can I 
smash it with a rock?

TASERFACE

No, Gef! It’s too adorable to kill. 
Bring it to the tailor.

INT. ECLECTOR CELL - OUTER SPACE

Yondu and Rocket settle.  Yondu looks like a beaten man.

ROCKET

No offense, but your employees are 
a bunch of jerks.

YONDU

I was a Kree battle-slave for 
twenty years when Stakar freed me. 
He offered me a place in the 
Ravagers. Said all I needed to do 
was adhere to the code. But I was 
young and greedy and stupid - like 
you stealing those batteries. 

ROCKET

That was mostly Drax.

YONDU

Me and Stakar, and the other 
captains - we weren’t so different 
from you and your friends. The only 
family I ever had. But I broke the 
code. They exiled me. 

YONDU (CONT’D)

These ones here are the ones who 
followed - of course they’re jerks. 
Which is what I deserve.

ROCKET

Slow down, drama queen. You might 
deserve this, but I don’t. We gotta 
get out of here.

YONDU

Where’s Quill?

ROCKET

Went off with his old man.

YONDU

Ego?

Yondu looks concerned. Rocket stares at him, picking this up.

ROCKET

Yeah. It’s a day for dumbass names. 

Yondu SNICKERS.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

You smiled and for a second I got a 
warm feeling, but then it was 
ruined by those disgusting-ass 
teeth. Ever heard of floss? 

Yondu’s smile disappears.

YONDU

You’re like a professional asshole 
or - ?

ROCKET

Pretty much a pro. Why didn’t you 
deliver Quill to Ego like you 
promised?

YONDU

He was skinny, could fit into 
places we couldn’t. Good for 
thieving.

Rocket nods, GRUMBLES.

YONDU (CONT’D)

I got an idea on how to get outta
here. But we’re gonna need your 
little friend.

INT. BAR/QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Baby Groot is wearing a tiny Ravager uniform. He reacts to 
clothes like a cat, struggling to take them off but unable.  
Ravagers are gathered around him, drunk and LAUGHING. They 
are CHANTING “MASCOT.”

RETCH

Lil’ feller’s all worked up! Needs 
a drank!

Retch POURS ALCOHOL on him. The Ravagers LAUGH MORE as others 
POUR DRINKS on him as well. Groot SCREAMS at them, furious 
but helpless.

RETCH (CONT’D)

Lookit how cute it is when it’s all 
riled up!

HALF-NUT

It’s Goddang precious!

INT. ECLECTOR CELL - LATER

Groot, in shadows, MOPES down the hallway, looking 
traumatized. His clothes are torn and he’s soaked in alcohol. 

As he passes the cell, he hears -

YONDU (O.S.)

Hey, twig. C’mere. 

Groot sees Yondu and Rocket looking at him in the cell. He 
steps toward them.  

ROCKET

Oh, man. What’d they do to you?

YONDU

Hey, you wanna help us get outta
here? 

Groot NODS.  Rocket looks unsure. Yondu speaks slowly.

YONDU (CONT’D)

There’s something I need you to 
get, and bring back to me.

Groot NODS.

YONDU (CONT’D)

In the Cap’n’s quarters, there’s a 
prototype fin, like the thing I 
wore on my head.

Groot NODS.

YONDU (CONT’D)

There’s a drawer next to the bunk. 
It’s inside that.  It’s red.  You 
got it?

Groot NODS EMPHATICALLY and DARTS OFF to get it.  Yondu looks 
at Rocket, pleased.  

Rocket looks more than a bit uncertain.

INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

Baby Groot CREEPS into this dark room.  DRUNKEN RAVAGERS are 
sprawled everywhere.  

He spots a bureau.  A drawer is half open.  

His face lights up.

MOMENTS LATER

Baby Groot stands outside of the cell, beaming, holding A 
PAIR OF SHORTS.

YONDU

That’s my underwears.

ROCKET

Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn’t 
know what you were talking about. 
You have to explain it more 
careful.

YONDU

All right. It’s a prototype fin -

MOMENTS LATER

Groot is back in front of the cell, holding a wriggling 
ORLONI in his hands.

ROCKET

That’s an orloni. It’s a fin, 
Groot.  

YONDU

You explain it this time.

Rocket starts to speak -

MOMENTS LATER

Groot looks hopeful, holding out a CYBERNETIC EYE.

YONDU

That’s Vorker’s eye. He takes it 
out when he sleeps.  Go look again.

Groot starts to SLINK OFF -

ROCKET

But leave the eye here.

YONDU

Why?

Rocket CAN HARDLY SPEAK he finds it so funny.

ROCKET

He’s gonna wake up tomorrow and 
he’s not gonna know where his eye 
is!

MOMENTS LATER

Groot is DRAGGING a LARGE PIECE OF FURNITURE to the cell.

ROCKET

That’s a desk. We told you it was 
this big.

Rocket shows him how small it is with his hands. 

Groot makes a face like “Oh!” as if NOW he gets it. It’s all 
coming together.

MOMENTS LATER

Groot is holding a SEVERED TOE.

ROCKET

Tell me you guys have a 
refrigerator somewhere with a bunch 
of severed human toes.

Yondu SUBTLY SHAKES HIS HEAD.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

Okay, then let’s just agree to 
never discuss this.

Yondu RIPS the Ravager patch off his jacket.
YONDU

The drawer you want to open. Has 
this symbol on it, okay?

Groot takes it. He looks at Yondu and NODS. 

And then, slowly, HE PLACES IT ON TOP OF HIS HEAD.

YONDU (CONT’D)

What? No.

ROCKET

He thinks you want him to wear it 
as a hat.

YONDU

That’s not what I said.

Groot takes it off his head.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

(translating)

He’s relieved that you don’t want 
him to.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

He hates hats.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

On anyone, not just himself.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

One minute you think someone has a 
weird-shaped head. The next minute, 
it’s just because you realize part 
of that head is a hat. 

(to Groot)

That’s why you don’t like hats?

Groot nods.

YONDU

This is an important conversation 
right now? 

ROCKET

No.  Let’s try again.

INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

Taserface is SNORING and SLOBBERING in his bed.  We see the 
Ravager Patch tossed up onto the bed beside him.  Then 
Groot’s vines GROW up the bed, and he pulls himself up beside 
the sleeping giant.

Groot clasps the Ravager patch in his hand and looks 
fearfully around.  

He spots the Ravager symbol on a night stand drawer. 

He stares at the symbol in his hand, then at the drawer, then 
at the symbol, and then at the drawer again, and then one 
more time for good measure -- he wants to be very, very sure 
they’re the same.

He creeps carefully towards the drawer, GROWING his vines out 
to grab the handle and PULL IT slowly open...

He peers inside.

Beside some writing instruments and a tin of candies, there 
lies a RED FIN, taller and more shark-like than Yondu’s 
current model.  Groot smiles hugely, picking up -

THE TIN OF CANDIES! He’s found it!

KRAGLIN (O.S.)

That ain’t it.

Groot SWIRLS to see KRAGLIN, BACKLIT IN THE DOORWAY, LOOMING 
OVER HIM, intimidating as hell.  And CUT TO --

INT. ECLECTOR CELL - MOMENTS LATER

The RED FIN PLOPS DOWN at Yondu’s feet.  

Yondu and Rocket look up to see Kraglin, holding Groot. He 
stares at the ground -

KRAGLIN

I didn’t mean to do a mutiny.

(pause, then, sadly)

They killed all my friends.

YONDU

Go get the third quadrant ready for 
release.

Kraglin SALUTES. 

ROCKET

One more thing.

Kraglin stares at him. 

ROCKET (CONT’D)

You got any clones of Quill’s old 
music on the ship?

INT. ECLECTOR BATHROOM - OUTER SPACE

Brahl is shaving, when, suddenly, JAY AND THE AMERICAN’S 
“COME A LITTLE BIT CLOSER” STARTS PLAYING over the intercom.  

He looks up, confused.

INT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY/CELL - OUTER SPACE

TWO RAVAGERS outside the cell hear the MUSIC.  They turn, 
unlocking the cell door.

As they enter, THE CAMERA OVERTAKES them, arriving before 
they do at --

Yondu, sitting calmly; Rocket is finishing ATTACHING THE BIG-
ASS FIN TO HIS HEAD. Its electrical systems POP on. 

PUSH IN ON the two surprised Ravagers trying to UNHOLSTER
THEIR PISTOLS in time.  

Too late.

Yondu WHISTLES.

INT. ECLECTOR CLOSET - OUTER SPACE

The ARROW FLIES OFF a shelf of supplies and SHOOTS TOWARD A 
WALL.

INT. ECLECTOR CELL - OUTER SPACE

The ARROW PUNCHES THROUGH THE WALL behind the Ravagers. They 
swirl to see it --

IT SHOOTS THROUGH ONE RAVAGER 

And THEN THE OTHER --

And then to Yondu; he CATCHES it, and STANDS.  

He SAUNTERS past the two Ravagers as they WOBBLE and FALL.  
Rocket and Groot follow.  

On the way out the door, Rocket looks down and sees TWO 
PISTOLS beside the dead Ravagers. 

He smiles.  

INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - OUTER SPACE

Taserface is awoken by JAY AND THE AMERICANS on the PA.  He 
glances over to see the open drawer beside him, sans 
gargantuan fin.  

He SCRAMBLES for the comm, yelling into it --

TASERFACE

He’s got it! 

INT. BAR/QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

The hoard of Ravagers hear Taserface’s voice.

TASERFACE (O.S.)

HE’S GOT IT! YONDU’S GOT THE DAMN 
FIN!

RETCH

GO!

SERIES OF SHOTS - INT. ALL OVER THE SHIP - OUTER SPACE

ALL OF THE RAVAGERS all over the ship, in a panic, LOAD THEIR 
WEAPONS and HEAD TOWARD THE CELL.

INT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE

Yondu and Rocket and Groot COME AROUND THIS CORNER IN SLOW-
MOTION, the three biggest badasses in the history of cinema.

A HOARD OF RAVAGERS, led by Brahl, FILE IN at the end of the 
hallway.

But Yondu WHISTLES and the ARROW TWISTS QUICKLY BACK AND 
FORTH, SLICING THROUGH EACH OF THEM.

Yondu SLAMS through a door into -

INT. ECLECTOR DOCKING BAY - OUTER SPACE

Our heroes step onto a catwalk in this, the biggest space in 
the Eclector.  There are catwalks throughout and dozens of 
docked M-ships. The SCURRILOUS RAVAGER sees them from above --

SCURRILOUS RAVAGER

Down there!

IN AN EXTREME WIDE ANGLE, we see the ARROW FLYING UP AND 
DOWN, BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS, CUTTING THROUGH ALL SORTS OF 
RAVAGERS, closer and further from CAMERA.  

We TRAVEL BEHIND YONDU AND ROCKET as BODIES FALL AROUND THEM 
IN SLOW-MOTION LIKE FIREWORKS.  

Groot looks up and sees RETCH looking down at him. 

RETCH FLEES in terror as Groot GROWS branches to pull himself 
up behind him. 

Groot HOWLS FURIOUSLY, TAKING CHASE. 

Retch YOWLS like a child as he frantically runs.

But Groot GROWS HIS BRANCHES around RETCH’s legs, TRIPPING 
HIM. 

BAM! He FALLS, face first to the floor.

And, with a WAR CRY, Baby Groot FLINGS the sadistic Ravager 
off the edge towards the abyss below.

As RETCH FALLS past Yondu and Rocket, Baby Groot DROPS back 
down onto Rocket’s shoulder, and they push their way through 
the doorway -

INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

Yondu, Rocket, and Groot move into this area, where they look 
up at DOZENS OF SECURITY MONITORS encircling them showing 
Ravagers filing toward them from every part of the ship.

Yondu WHISTLES as he watches the MONITORS -

ON A MONITOR, the arrow FLIES out the wall. He whistles so 
that it strikes TWO RAVAGERS running towards them.

It ZIPS out of that room and

INT. DARK HALL - OUTER SPACE

A HOARD of Ravagers come running down a hall. The ARROW ZIPS 
overhead, smashing out all the lights so that the hall is 
completely dark, except for the DIM RED LIGHT OF THE ARROW.

And we can just make out the RED LIGHT smashing through the 
body of every Ravager there and then on into --

INT. SPACEPORT - OUTER SPACE

A YELLING CROWD OF RAVAGERS come, hungry for war, when the 
arrow SHOOTS THROUGH THE CHAINS holding a giant spaceship in 
place over their heads.  

It FALLS, instantly CRUSHING them all, and then zips on --

INT. BAR - OUTER SPACE

Gef the Ravager is drunkenly drinking a mug of beer, when the 
arrow zips past him and through the mug, SHATTERING it.

As Gef looks at the shattered mug, confused, the arrow comes 
flying back, ripping through Gef himself, FLINGING him off 
the bar stool.

INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

Rocket also uses the MONITORS to pinpoint where their 
attackers are.  He methodically SHOOTS THROUGH the walls, 
striking the Ravagers as they get closer.

WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT, the CAMERA REVOLVES as hoards of Ravagers 
GET CLOSE to Yondu and Rocket but the arrow and gunshots ZIP 
THROUGH THE WALLS taking them all down, one by one, like 
Busby Berkely gone mad.

Then Yondu stops, seeing something on one of the MONITORS.

Taserface, clutching a big ass gun, is marching down the hall 
towards them. 

Yondu WHISTLES, loudly and angrily.

INTERCUT - INT. ENGINE ROOM/SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

Taserface sees THE ARROW COMING AROUND A CORNER TOWARDS HIM.

Yondu WHISTLES again.

The ARROW BURSTS INTO FLAMES.

Taserface DODGES it.

He turns to watch it go, CACKLING pridefully over his 
agility.

But his smile quickly dissipates.

The arrow PLUNGES into a giant tank - which EXPLODES, 
ENGULFING HIM.

EXT. ECLECTOR - OUTER SPACE

A huge portion of the giant spacecraft EXPLODES, leading to a 
domino effect of one part of the ship BURSTING after another.

INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

ROCKET is dumbfounded as he sees on the MONITORS the numerous 
EXPLOSIONS throughout the ship.

ROCKET

You maniac. The whole ship is gonna
blow.

INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

A DOOR SWINGS OPEN and TASERFACE FALLS ONTO THE FLOOR, 
ENGULFED IN FLAMES, but furious.

He angrily SLAPS off the flames as he reaches for a 
COMMUNICATIONS MODULE.

INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

YONDU

Not the whole ship.

Yondu catches the arrow and walks out.

INT. BAR/QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Kraglin ENTERS, pulling latches and flipping switches and 
twisting dials on elementary flight controls. 

INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

With pained effort, Taserface PULLS UP A VIDEO SCREEN with a 
SOVEREIGN CHAMBERMAID.

CHAMBERMAID (ON SCREEN)

Who is this? You’re not supposed to 
be on this line. 

TASERFACE

I’m sending you the coordinates for 
Yondu’s ship.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Yondu enters with Rocket and Groot. 

YONDU

Release the quadrant.

KRAGLIN

Aye Capn’

INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

TASERFACE

I only ask one thing. That your 
High Priestess tells him the name 
of the man what sealed his fate: 
Taserface.

The CHAMBERMAID laughs uncontrollably at his name.

Taserface looks really sad as he EXPLODES.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

As Rocket and Groot, frightened, feel the SHIP EXPLODING 
around them, Kraglin pulls up one final latch - 

EXT. ECLECTOR - OUTER SPACE

THE ENTIRE REAR UPPER QUADRANT OF THE ECLECTOR DETACHES FROM 
THE REST OF THE SHIP, while the remains CONTINUE EXPLODING.

I/E. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Rocket and Groot are amazed as the SHIP thrusts forward, away 
from the explosions. 

Kraglin keys into a JUMP POINT ahead. Nearby, Rocket pulls up 
the Navigation panel.

KRAGLIN

Where to, Cap’n?

Rocket SETS THE DESTINATION:

ROCKET

Ego.

YONDU

NO, BOY!

The Quadrant TREMBLES as they hit THE JUMP POINT.  It BLOOPS
out of present space, making the JUMP to -

EXT. DESERT - DAY

The Quadrant POPS into a blue sky above a DESERT with two 
fighting KRONANS.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - VARIOUS OUTER SPACE LOCATIONS

Inside the ship, Rocket, Yondu, Kraglin, and baby Groot hold 
on for dear life as the ship VIOLENTLY SHAKES and THE 
LOCATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE WINDOW RAPIDLY SHIFT. 

Their bodies DISTEND SLIGHTLY. Yondu is furious.

YONDU

It ain’t healthy for a mammalian 
body to hop over fifty jumps at a 
time.

ROCKET

I know that.

YONDU

We’re about to do seven-hundred.

Rocket looks bummed.

EXT. PINK SKY - AMOEBA BLOBS - OUTER SPACE

The Quadrant pops out of a jump point into this Pepto Bismol
pink land, SMASHING THROUGH an AMOEBA-LIKE BLOB, and then 
through the next jump point.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - VARIOUS OUTER SPACE LOCATIONS

Kraglin, Yondu, Rocket, and Baby Groot all SCREAM, their 
entire faces and bodies distorting as if in some evil 
funhouse mirror.

EXT. RED PLANET LANDSCAPE - VARIOUS

The yellow sun CURVES SLOWLY WEST TO EAST over this 
magnificent landscape. 

“BRING IT ON HOME TO ME” BY SAM COOKE PLAYS.

EXT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - VERANDA - DAY

TILT DOWN to Quill, on this veranda, gazing out at the 
beauty.  The Walkman is connected to small, jerry-rigged
speakers nearby, PLAYING SAM COOKE.  

QUILL

So I guess this could all be mine 
someday.

Gamora isn’t paying attention. She’s fooling with a 
communications device, which has no reception.

GAMORA

Rocket? Rocket, you there?  Dammit.

Quill comes up behind her, messing with her.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

What are you doing, Peter?

QUILL

Dance with me.

GAMORA

No. I’m not --

QUILL

Come on. This is Sam Cooke, one of 
the greatest Earth singers of all 
time.

Gamora lets out an exasperated SIGH, but, reluctantly, starts 
DANCING with him. She is incredibly light on her feet. 

Quill smiles and Gamora, despite herself, does as well.  He 
TWIRLS HER AND BRINGS HER BACK IN. This is definitely not the 
first time they’ve done this.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Drax thinks you’re not a dancer.

GAMORA

If you ever tell anyone about this, 
I’ll kill you.

They look at each other. 

QUILL

When are we going to do something 
about this... unspoken thing 
between us?

GAMORA

What unspoken thing?

QUILL

This Cheers-Sam-and-Diane-guy-and-
girl-on-a-TV-show-who-dig-each-
other-but-never-say-it-’cause-when-
they-do-the-ratings-would-go-down 
sort of thing?

GAMORA

There is no unspoken thing between 
us. 

QUILL

Well, that’s a Catch-22. Because if 
you said there was, it would be 
spoken, and then you’d be a liar. 
So by saying there isn’t, you’re 
telling the truth, and admitting 
there is.

GAMORA

That’s not --

Gamora PULLS AWAY.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

What we should be discussing right 
now is that something about this 
place doesn’t feel right.

QUILL

What are you talking about? You 
were the one who wanted me to come 
here!

Gamora moves into --

INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - DAY

GAMORA

That girl, Mantis. She’s afraid of 
something. 

Quill follows her.  He stops, staring at her, hurt and 
frustrated.

QUILL

Why are you trying to take this 
from me?

GAMORA

I’m not --

QUILL

He’s my father. He’s blood -

GAMORA

You have blood on earth. You never 
wanted to return there.

QUILL

Again - you made me come here!
And Earth?! Earth is the place my 
mother died in front of me. 

GAMORA

No, it’s because that’s real, and 
this is a fantasy.

QUILL

This is real. I’m only half human, 
remember?

GAMORA

That’s the half I’m worried about. 

QUILL

Oh, I get it. You’re jealous 
because I’m part god! You like me 
being the weak one!

Gamora adds some pieces to her transmitter.

GAMORA

Uh. You were insufferable to begin 
with. I haven’t been able to reach 
Rocket. I’m going to see if I can 
get a signal outside.

QUILL

You know, this isn’t Cheers after 
all. It’s whatever the show is 
where one person is willing to, you 
know, open themselves up to new 
possibilities, and the other person 
is just kind of a jerk who doesn’t 
trust anyone! It’s a show that 
doesn’t exist - it would never be 
made, it would be so horrible! It 
would get zero ratings!

GAMORA

You’re having a conversation with 
yourself! I don’t know what Cheers 
is!

QUILL

I finally found my family, don’t 
you understand that!?

GAMORA

I thought you already had.

QUILL

So this is how it ends, then? Our 
whole story. Like this? You and me?

GAMORA

Get it through your head, Peter. 
There is no you and me. There never 
was.

Quill watches her leave.

EXT. EGO’S FIELDS - SUNSET

Gamora sits, alone in the fields, pouting, fuming.  She 
stops, staring angrily inward.  

Two plants, nearby, flitter against one another in the wind, 
making a CLICKING sound. She side-eyes them. They don’t stop.  

She slices them off with her sword.

GAMORA

Dammit.

Gamora hears something. She turns to see, in the distance, an 
M-ship flying toward the planet.  

She watches as it gets closer and closer, and realizes it is 
FLYING DIRECTLY AT HER.

Gamora RUNS.

INT. NEBULA’S SHIP - SUNSET

Nebula HOLLERS as she BLASTS HER GUNS, DIVING towards Gamora. 

EXT. HILLSIDE - SUNSET

Gamora FLEES from Nebula’s ship like Cary Grant from the crop 
duster in North by Northwest as HUGE CHUNKS OF LAND EXPLODE 
on either side of her. 

Gamora leaps into a DITCH, LANDING HARD, as the M-Ship SWOOPS 
just a couple feet above her.

GAMORA

You psychopath.

Gamora sees the M-Ship banking and FLYING BACK at her again. 

She stands and runs along the hillside as GUN BLASTS burst 
behind her.  But Gamora sees a CAVERN, leading down into the 
earth.

She DARTS into it.

INT. EGO’S CAVERN - FIRST/SECOND LEVELS - SUNSET

As Gamora RUNS down the cavern, she glances back over her 
shoulder where Nebula, insane with rage, continues FLYING 
towards her --

The M-SHIP ENTERS THE CAVERN, which is too small for it, 
CLIPPING ITS WINGS - but it keeps flying. It again BLASTS at 
Gamora as she FLEES - 

The BLASTS cause the ground to COLLAPSE around Gamora, and 
she FALLS, SMASHING DOWN THROUGH ONE LEVEL, to another level 
below, SLAMMING HARD on the ground. 

The underside of the M-ship gets SCRAPED APART as it flies 
above her, and pieces of it come RAINING DOWN around her.

Nebula ZOOMS towards a huge cavern wall.  She tries to turn 
her ship in time, to no avail.  

She SIDESWIPES it, falling down, CRASHING on the ground, 
where she is now on the same level as Gamora.

Gamora sees something beside her: it’s one of the ENORMOUS 
BLASTERS from the M-ship, attached to an AMMO RIG.

INT. NEBULA’S M-SHIP - SUNSET

Nebula sees Gamora, through the canopy, picking up the 
blaster, and clutching it. It is comically enormous. 

Nebula struggles to get free and out of the way, but her legs 
have been pinned in the crash - 

INT. EGO’S CAVERN - SECOND/THIRD LEVELS - SUNSET

Gamora CLAMPS two metal switches together, MACHINE-FIRING THE 
GUN, as she walks forward.  

The front of the M-ship is peppered with blasts and then 
EXPLODES. 

The explosion causes the thin ground around it to COLLAPSE, 
and the entire ship FALLS BACKWARDS to an even LOWER LEVEL - 
BURSTING some more as it hits the ground.

Gamora gazes down at the ship.

I/E. NEBULA’S SQUASHED M-SHIP - SUNSET

Nebula is a mess.  Her legs are broken, trapped in the ship.  
There is a FIRE at her feet.  

She struggles, trying to get out, but her machine parts are 
SPARKING and she can hardly breathe. It seems as she’s going 
to die, when --

Part of the ship is TORN AWAY.  She sees Gamora.

Gamora GRABS HER, unceremoniously PULLING HER FREE, just as 
the M-ship EXPLODES, PITCHING THEM BOTH to the ground.

They lie next to each other. Nebula COUGHS as her legs are 
healing, CRACKING back into place.  

She looks over and eyes Gamora.  

And then she HOLLERS and attacks her.  

GAMORA

Are you kidding me?!

They FIGHT.

Nebula snatches Gamora’s blade from her, and TUMBLES on top 
of her as she gains the upper hand.  She holds the blade 
above Gamora, ready to plummet it into her. 

She wants to - she really does - but now that the moment is 
here...  

She SCREAMS in frustration, and falls back.

NEBULA

I win.

Gamora eyes her, a little surprised.

NEBULA (CONT’D)

I win. I bested you in combat.

GAMORA

Uh, no, I just spared your life -

NEBULA

You were stupid enough to let me 
live so - 

GAMORA

You just let me live!

NEBULA

I WIN!

GAMORA

Nebula, I really don’t need 
this. My day has been bad 
enough -

NEBULA (CONT'D)

I don’t need you always 
trying to beat me!

GAMORA

I’m not the one who just flew 
across the universe because I 
wanted to win!

NEBULA

Don’t tell me what I want!

GAMORA

I don’t have to because you make it 
obvi -

NEBULA

YOU WERE THE ONE WHO WANTED TO WIN, 
I JUST WANTED A SISTER!

Gamora stops suddenly, struck.  Nebula is cracking.

NEBULA (CONT’D)

You were all I had, but you were 
the one who needed to win! Thanos
pulled my eye from my head and my 
brain from my skull and my arm from 
my body because of you!

Gamora doesn’t know what to say. Nebula is almost instantly 
embarrassed. 

They sit there for a moment, saying nothing.

EXT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

The Quarters are entombed in stars. The dim sound of “BRANDY” 
comes from within.

INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

Quill lies in bed, unable to sleep, listening to the song.  

EGO (O.S.)

You all right, son?

Quill turns to see Ego in the doorway. 

EGO (CONT’D)

I saw your girl stomp off earlier 
in quite a huff.

Quill sits up, nods.

QUILL

Yeah.

Ego sits beside him.

EGO

It’s fortuitous you’re listening to 
this song.

QUILL

You know - ?

EGO

‘Brandy’ by Looking Glass.  A 
favorite of your mom’s. 

QUILL

Yes.

EGO

One of earth’s greatest musical 
compositions. Perhaps its very 
greatest.

QUILL

Yeah, it is.

EGO

You and I, Peter, we’re the sailor 
in the song.

Ego speaks along with the lyrics as they play.

EGO (CONT’D)

He came on a summer’s day, bringing 
gifts from far away - like the 
child I put in your mother, or the 
freedom you brought Gamora.

Quill listens.

EGO (CONT’D)

Brandy, you’re a fine girl, what a 
good wife you would be. But my 
life, my love, my lady is the sea.
The sea calls the sailor back.  He 
loves the girl, but that’s not his 
place.  The sea calls upon him as 
history calls upon great men, and 
sometimes we are deprived the 
pleasures of mortals.

QUILL

Well, you might not be mortal, but 
me - 

EGO

Death will remain a stranger to 
both of us as long as the light 
burns within the planet.

Ego smiles.

QUILL

I’m immortal? That’s... really?

EGO

Yes, as long as the light exists. 

QUILL

And I can use the light to make 
cool things? Like how you made all 
this?

EGO

It’ll take thousands of years of 
practice before you get really good 
at it . But, yes. 

QUILL

Well, get ready for an eight 
hundred foot statue of Pac Man, 
then. With Skeletor. And Heather 
Locklear. I’m gonna make some weird 
shit.

Ego puts his arm around him, smiles kindly.

EGO

I can’t wait to see your weird 
shit.

QUILL

Wow, that...

EGO

Came out a little disgusting.

They CHUCKLE.

EGO (CONT’D)

It is a tremendous responsibility, 
Peter. Only we can remake the 
universe. Only we can take the 
bridle of the cosmos and lead it 
where it needs to go.

QUILL

How?

Ego holds up his fingers, letting forth a flame of white 
cosmic light. Quill holds up his fingers, letting forth a 
smaller, less intense flame of white cosmic light.

REVEAL MANTIS, IN THE HALL, around the corner, looking at Ego 
and Quill and the light emanating from their fingers.

EGO

Come with me.

Mantis looks like she’s having a panic attack.

INT. DRAX’S SLEEPING QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE-UP OF DRAX, sound asleep.

MANTIS (O.S.)

Drax! Drax!

He WAKES to see a panicked Mantis sitting on the bed beside 
him.

MANTIS (CONT’D)

Drax, we need to talk -

DRAX

Ugh. I am sorry, but I like a woman 
with some meat on her bones.

MANTIS

What?

DRAX

I tried to let you down easily by 
telling you I found you disgusting.

MANTIS

No! That’s not what I - 

Drax starts to GAG. 

MANTIS (CONT’D)

What are you doing?!

DRAX

I’m imagining being with you 
physically!

MANTIS

Drax, that’s not - I don’t like you 
like that. I don’t even like the 
type of thing you are. 

DRAX

(offended)

Hey! There’s no need to get 
personal!

MANTIS

Listen! Ego’s gotten exactly what 
he wanted. I should have told you 
earlier, I am stupid. You are in 
danger. 

EXT. NEBULA’S SQUASHED M-SHIP - NIGHT

Gamora and Nebula still sit here, quietly and awkwardly.  
Gamora glances down a twisting tunnel, where phosphorescent 
lights shine brightly.

GAMORA

What’s that?

She moves towards it.  Nebula, hesitantly, follows.

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

Ego and Quill enter the palace. 

EGO

You need to readjust the way you 
process life. Everything around us - 
including the girl - is temporary. 
We are forever.

QUILL

Doesn’t eternity get boring?

EGO

Not if you have a purpose, Peter. 
Which is why you’re here. I told 
you how all those years ago I had 
an unceasing impulse to find life.

Ego is standing underneath the diorama of him facing the 
little alien girl.

EGO (CONT’D)

I didn’t tell you how when I did 
find it, it was all so... 
disappointing.

INT. TWISTING CAVERNS - NIGHT

Gamora and Nebula move further down the cavern, stepping into 
light, getting closer.

EGO

And that is when I came to a 
profound realization. 

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

EGO

My innate desire to seek out other 
life was not so that I could walk 
among that life. 

Ego looks at his son, moved by the memories.  

EGO (CONT’D)

Peter, I had found meaning.

Quill is taken aback. But Ego sets his finger lightly on his 
forehead, and the white light bursts through his son’s body. 

We see THE COSMOS IN QUILL’S EYES. He looks ecstatic, far 
beyond where he stands, and seems to finally understand.

QUILL

I see it. Eternity.

INT. TWISTING CAVERNS - NIGHT

Gamora and Nebula stop, in horror.

GAMORA

Oh my God.

They are staring at piles and piles of skeletons of various 
species, thousands of them, seeming to go on forever.

NEBULA

We need to get off this planet.

EXT. GALAXY/UNIVERSE - OUTER SPACE

We see traces of the UNIVERSAL NEURAL TELEPORTATION NETWORK, 
the Quadrant a blinking light POPPING IN and OUT on a trail 
across the cosmos -

And then ZOOM BACK FURTHER TO THE UNIVERSE, the same blinking 
light making its way while ROCKET, YONDU, and KRAGLIN SCREAM.

EXT. ASTEROIDS - OUTER SPACE

WATCHERS swirl to the Quadrant SWISH past them and JUMPS OUT. 

They turn back to STAN LEE, in a spacesuit with a fishbowl 
helmet.

STAN LEE

Anyway, before I was so rudely 
interrupted, that time I was a 
World War II vet - 

EXT. RED PLANET - OUTER SPACE

THE QUADRANT POPS INTO SPACE, EGO’S PLANET nearby.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Yondu, Kraglin, Rocket and Groot FALL OUT OF THEIR SEATS, 
RETCHING, clutching their stomachs. 

YONDU

What the hell you doing, boy?!

ROCKET

I could tell by how you talked 
about him - this Ego is bad news. 
We’re here to save Quill.

YONDU

For what?

(derisively)

For ‘honor’? For ‘love’?

ROCKET

No! I don’t care about those 
things! I want to save Quill so I 
can prove I’m better than him! I 
can lord this over him forever!

Yondu LAUGHS bitterly as he pulls himself up to the controls. 
Rocket yanks himself up beside him.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

What are you laughing at me for?!

YONDU

You can fool yourself and everyone 
else but you can’t fool me. I know 
who you are.

ROCKET

You don’t know anything about me, 
loser.

YONDU

I know everything about you. I know 
you play like the meanest and the 
hardest ‘cause you actually the 
most scared of all.

ROCKET

Shut up.

YONDU

I know you steal batteries you 
don’t need and you push away anyone 
who’s willing to put up with you, 
‘cause just a little bit of love 
reminds you how big and empty that 
hole inside you actually is! 

ROCKET

I said, shut up.

YONDU

I know the scientists what made you 
never gave a rat’s ass about you -

ROCKET

I’m serious, dude - !

YONDU

Just like my own damn parents, who 
sold me, their own little baby, 
into slavery! I know who you are, 
boy, because you’re me.

They stare at each other there, a mirror. 

ROCKET

What kind of pair are we?

YONDU

The kind that’s about to go fight a 
planet I reckon.

ROCKET

All right, okay, that’s - Wait. 
Fight a what?

INT. DRAX’S SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

Gamora, furious, BURSTS into the room.  She sees Mantis 
standing with Drax. 

She RUNS to her, GRABBING HER by the neck --

DRAX

Hey!

And she SLAMS her against the wall.

GAMORA

Who are you people?! What is this 
place?!

DRAX

(re: Nebula)

What is she doing here?

NEBULA

Just watching the fireworks.

DRAX

Gamora, let her go! 

GAMORA

The bodies in the caverns, who are 
they?!

MANTIS

You are scared.

Gamora, whose skin is touching Mantis, lets go of her neck, 
terrified. 

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

The DIORAMAS all around Quill and Ego TRANSFORM into a map of 
the universe.  Quill stares in his cosmic reverie at the 
PLANETS around him - thousands of them with pieces of EGO’S 
LIFEFORM - GLOWING COSMIC PLANTS - buried within them.

EGO

I call it the Expansion. It is my 
purpose. And now it’s yours as 
well. 

QUILL

It’s beautiful.

Quill stares up at a DIORAMA: Ego grabs handfuls of his own 
body, engulfed in light, and plants the wriggling pieces on 
various planets. 

EGO

Over thousands of years I implanted 
thousands of extensions of myself 
on thousands of worlds. 

In the DIORAMAS, the COSMIC PLANTS OVERGROW and COVER each of 
the planets, like chocolate on a malt ball.

EGO (CONT’D)

I needed to fulfill life’s one true 
purpose: to grow and to spread, 
covering all that exists, until 
everything... is me.

INT. DRAX’S SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

Gamora backs away, recovering.

GAMORA

What did she do to me?!

DRAX

She already told me everything.

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

EGO

I only had one problem. A single 
Celestial doesn’t have enough power 
for such an enterprise. But two 
Celestials - well now, that just 
might do.

INT. DRAX’S SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

MANTIS

The bodies are his children.

Gamora is horrified.

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

On the DIORAMAS we see Ego with hundreds of species of female 
aliens.

EGO

Out of all my labors the most 
beguiling was attempting to graft 
my DNA with that of another 
species. I hoped the result of such 
a coupling would be enough to power 
the expansion.

INT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

Yondu and Rocket walk here.

EGO (O.S.)

I had Yondu deliver some of them to 
me. It broke the Ravager code - but 
I compensated him generously. And, 
to ease his conscience, I told him 
I would never hurt them.

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

EGO

That was true. They never felt a 
thing. But, one after the other, 
they failed me. None of them had 
the Celestial genes. Until you, 
Peter. Out of all my spawn, only 
you have carried the connection to 
the light. 

Peter smiles, an enchanted idiot, the cosmos in his eyes.

INT. DRAX’S SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT 

GAMORA

We need to find Peter now and get 
off this damn planet.

MANTIS

Ego will have won him to his side 
by now. He has a way of - 

NEBULA

Then we just go.

GAMORA

No. He’s our friend.

NEBULA 

All any of you do is yell at each 
other. You’re not friends.

DRAX

You’re right. We’re family. 
We leave no one behind. 

(To Nebula)

Except maybe you.

NEBULA

Oh my god. 

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

EGO

For the first time in my life, I am 
truly not alone.

Quill suddenly looks sad.

EGO (CONT’D)

What is it, son?

QUILL

My friends.

EGO

That’s the mortal in you, Peter.

QUILL

Yes. I don’t need that.

EGO

What are we?

QUILL

Forever.

EGO

What are they?

QUILL

Temporary.

EGO

You think you love them. But love 
is merely an evolutionary trick in 
the service of reproduction. We are 
beyond such things.

QUILL

Yes.

EGO

Now - 

QUILL

But my mother.

Ego looks at him, questioningly.

QUILL (CONT’D)

You said you loved my mother.

EGO

That I did. My river lily, who knew 
the words to every song that came 
on the radio. I returned to earth 
to see her three times. I knew if I 
came back a fourth, I’d never 
leave.  

(MORE)

The expansion, the reason for my 
very existence would be over.  So I 
did what I had to do. But it broke 
my heart to put that tumor in her 
head. 

QUILL

Wh- what?

ZOLLY IN ON QUILL as the cosmos disappear from his eyes. 
Tears stream down his face.

EGO

I know that sounds bad - 

QUILL PULLS OUT HIS PISTOLS AND FIRES; THE BLAST TEARS 
THROUGH EGO, DISPERSING the MOLECULES forming his body.  

Quill SHOOTS at him AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN.  The flesh 
disappears from Ego like bites from a cookie, exposing the 
angry alien skeletal form beneath. 

But, as the charge on Peter’s blasters wears out, Ego just 
looks at him, and, although he’s filled with holes, he’s 
merely disappointed.

EGO (CONT’D)

Who in the hell do you think you 
are?

QUILL

You killed my mother!

EGO TRANSFORMS into DAVID HASSELHOFF.

EGO

I tried so hard to find the form 
that best suited you, and this is 
the thanks I get?

And then, once again, BECOMES HIS USUAL FORM.

EGO (CONT’D)

You really need to grow up.

A SPIKY COSMIC LIGHT-PROPELLED TENDRIL SHOOTS UP from the 
floor behind Quill, and JUTS into Quill’s body.  

Quill is THRUST INTO THE AIR.  He opens his mouth to SCREAM 
and WHITE LIGHT EMITS. 

EGO (CONT'D)

EGO (CONT’D)

I wanted to do this together! But I 
suppose you’ll have to learn by 
spending the next thousand years as 
a battery, ‘Star-Lord’.

INT. DRAX’S SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

THROUGH THE WINDOW to the PALACE - PAN TO Gamora watching as 
her TRANSMITTER - the one she was trying to contact Rocket on 
- BEEPS.  She answers.

GAMORA

Rocket?!

Gamora follows Drax, Nebula, and a confused Mantis as they 
move out.

INT. LASER DRILL - OUTER SPACE

Rocket, Yondu, and Groot are CRAWLING into a huge LASER 
DRILL.  

ROCKET

Keep that transmitter nearby so I 
can find you. We’re in an old piece 
of construction equipment Yondu 
once used to slice open the Bank of 
A’askavaria.

GAMORA (O.S.)

Ego’s unhinged -

ROCKET

I know. Get ready.

YONDU

Drop it, Kraglin!

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Kraglin YANKS a lever. 

I/E. LASER DRILL - OUTER SPACE

An ugly, bulbous and uneven craft PLOPS from the Quadrant, 
and heads toward Ego’s surface.

ROCKET

I got a plan.

YONDU

What is it?

ROCKET

It’s pretty simple.

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

Ego walks calmly up beside the trapped Quill. He snatches the 
Walkman off of him. He stares at it. Quill can barely speak.

QUILL

NO.

EGO PRESSES PLAY.  A distorted version of “Brandy” plays.  He 
stares at it - perhaps he’s feeling wistful sadness, or 
perhaps nothing at all.

‘Brandy, you’re a fine girl. What a good wife you would be.’

EGO

‘My life, my love, my lady is the 
sea’? Peter, THIS IS THE SEA.

EGO CRUSHES THE WALKMAN IN HIS GRIP as Quill watches 
helplessly.  

The POWER SURGES from Quill through the TENTACLE and 
throughout the entire PALACE --

EXT. PALACE - NIGHT

As Gamora, Mantis, Drax, and Nebula run toward the Palace it 
BURSTS WITH COSMIC LIGHT, so brightly they have to protect 
their eyes.

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

EGO basks in the power and we TRAVEL down his legs --

INT. RED PLANET/SELF CHAMBER - NIGHT

We FOLLOW THE ENERGY THROUGH THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET --

THROUGH THE TWISTING VEINS OF LIGHT BENEATH -- 

And INTO an ENORMOUS, METAL ORB, the SELF CHAMBER, which 
EXPLODES WITH LIGHT.  

Boom.

EARTH - EXT. WOODS BEHIND DAIRY QUEEN - MOMENTS LATER

We PUSH INTO the small plant - now a bit larger - that Ego 
planted at the very beginning of the film. 

It LIGHTS UP and GROWS, INSTANTLY BURSTING UPWARDS - 

EARTH - EXT. DQ - MOMENTS LATER

The PLANT BURSTS UP BEHIND the Dairy Queen (now a modern DQ), 
a huge ORGANIC, BLOB-LIKE MASS OF LIGHT that comes down 
instantly on the building, CRUSHING it and everyone inside --

AND CONTINUING TO SPILL FORWARD, SPREADING.

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

EGO SUMMONS all his energy, when, SUDDENLY, a DOOR beside him 
SMASHES APART. 

Drax has kicked through it and Gamora, Nebula and Mantis are 
with him. Ego turns to see them, then hears a RUMBLING above 
him.

He turns to look at a window on the palace wall behind him.

AND THE GIANT LASER DRILL COMES SMASHING THROUGH THE PALACE 
WALL. 

YONDU

Hey there, Jackass.

Ego looks surprised.

The LASER DRILL lands on Ego, SQUASHING HIM. 

The tendril retracts from Quill as he falls and heaves for 
breath.

EARTH - EXT. STREET - DAY

The cosmic plant, barreling down the street, suddenly STOPS.

INT. PALACE/LASER DRILL - SUNRISE

Drax, Gamora, Nebula, and Mantis rush into the crumbling 
palace.

The door on the side of the Laser Drill SLIDES OPEN. Baby 
Groot is standing there, smiling, and waving. 

DRAX

Out of the way, dumber, smaller 
Groot.

As Drax crawls in, Groot starts PUNCHING Drax as hard as he 
can. Probably because he called him dumb, but who’s to say.

Gamora helps up Quill.

GAMORA

I told you something didn’t feel 
right.

QUILL

‘I told you so.’ That’s really what 
I need right now.

GAMORA

I came back, didn’t I?

QUILL

Because there’s an unspoken thing.

GAMORA

There is no unspoken thing.

INT. LASER DRILL - NIGHT

Drax, Mantis, Gamora, and Quill step inside the door.

DRAX

What are you doing? You could have 
killed us all crashing in here like 
that!

ROCKET

Uh, ‘Thank you, Rocket’? 

DRAX

We had it under control.

MANTIS

We did not. That is only an 
extension of his true self. He will 
be back soon.

QUILL

(re: Nebula)

What’s Smurfette doing here!? 

NEBULA

Back rubs, dishes, killing gods, 
whatever I need to do to get a damn 
ride home.

ROCKET

She tried to murder me!

NEBULA

I saved you, you stupid fox.

GAMORA

He’s not a fox.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

I’m not a raboon either!

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

‘Raccoon,’ whatever!

Drax looks out the window.

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

TENTACLE-LIKE STRANDS BURST UP through the palace flooring 
all around the drill.  

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

Drax turns to the others.

DRAX

How do we kill a Celestial?

QUILL

There’s the center to him - his 
brain, his soul, whatever it is, in 
some sort of shell -- 

MANTIS

It’s in the caverns below the 
surface.

Quill climbs up the ladder to see - 

QUILL

YONDU?

Nebula looks at Gamora.

NEBULA

If he’s got that fin back, I am so 
screwed.

I/E. PALACE - SUNRISE

Yondu THRUSTS the ship upward for takeoff.  But TENTACLES 
wrap around the ship --

And YANK IT BACK DOWN into the floor, destroying the 
foundation of the palce.  

THE ENTIRE PALACE SLOPES.

INT. LASER DRILL - SUNRISE

Everyone FALLS forward.

YONDU

Thrusters are out!

Quill starts rewiring the mechanics.

QUILL

I guess I should be glad I was a 
skinny kid. Otherwise you would 
have delivered me to this maniac!

YONDU

You still reckon that’s the reason 
I kept you around, you idiot?!

QUILL

That’s what you told me, you old 
doofus!

YONDU

Once I figured out what happened to 
them other kids, I wasn’t gonna
just hand you over.

QUILL

You said you were gonna eat me!

YONDU

That was being funny!

QUILL

Not to me!!

ROCKET

You people have issues.

Quill sees THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD where EGO’S CREEPY SKELETAL 
is GROWING IN FRONT OF THEM. 

QUILL

Of course I have issues that’s my 
fricking father!!... Thrusters are 
back up.

Quill thrusts the ship FORWARD instead of up.  

It CRASHES through Ego and DOWN THE SLOPING FLOOR --

And OUT THROUGH the giant pane of glass at the end.

I/E. LASER DRILL/CRACK IN THE PLANET - SUNRISE

Everyone holds on in what’s essentially the worst roller 
coaster drop ever. 

YONDU

We should be going up!

QUILL

We can’t. Ego wants to eradicate 
the universe as we know it. We have 
to kill him.

They PLUMMET toward a fissure in the earth below.  It’s too 
small for the ship.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Rocket!

ROCKET

Got it.

Rocket BLASTS the lasers perfectly, CHIPPING AWAY PIECES of 
rock, forming an opening in the crack.

They SMASH into the opening, barely fitting, leading down 
into the planet. 

Quill flies perfectly, TWISTING through tunnels and around 
corners.  

Rocket mans the lasers, BLASTING PIECES OUT OF PLACE just in 
time so they can SCRAPE through.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

So, we’re saving the galaxy again?

QUILL

I guess.

ROCKET

Awesome. We’ll really be able to 
jack up our prices if we’re two-
time-galaxy savers.

QUILL

I seriously can’t believe that is 
where your mind goes.

ROCKET

It was just a random thought, man! 
I thought we were friends! 

(MORE)

Of course I care about the planets, 
and the buildings, and all of the 
animals on the planets.

QUILL

And the people.

ROCKET

Meh.

Mantis GIGGLES.

MANTIS

The crabby puppy is so cute he 
makes me want to die!

DRAX

Your suicidal thoughts sadden me, 
but your wish will likely come 
true.

I/E. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

MEANWHILE, Kraglin is mellowly hanging out, eating some soup 
and listening to “WHAM BAM” BY SILVER as he sees something 
out in the distance of space.  He looks a bit closer.

SOVEREIGN OMNICRAFT ARE POPPING THROUGH JUMP POINTS ABOVE 
EGO’S PLANET.

EXT. AYESHA’S SPACECRAFT - OUTER SPACE

AYESHA is remotely piloting one of the ships.  She looks 
determined and angry on the vid-screen. 

And, one by one, Sovereign OMNICRAFT POP IN all around her, 
until there is a large fleet.  

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

Ayesha, in full pilot gear, yells into her comm.

AYESHA

Pilots, release envoy units!

EXT. AYESHA’S SPACECRAFT - OUTER SPACE

Smaller, more nimble robotic ENVOYS, like big pods with 
blasters for arms - detach from the front of every Omnicraft.

AYESHA

Our sensors detect the batteries 
are below the surface of the 
planet.

ROCKET (CONT'D)

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

AYESHA

Dive!

OVERHEAD SHOT: On the screens in all the pods, the envoys 
DIVE toward the planet from slightly different directions.

I/E. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Kraglin, in shock, watches the massive fleet of envoys diving 
downward. He grabs the comm.

KRAGLIN

Uhh... Cap’n?

No answer.

KRAGLIN (CONT’D)

Cap’n?

INT. LASER DRILL/CRACK IN THE PLANET - SUNRISE

Yondu doesn’t hear the CRACKLING SPEAKER beside him as they 
maneuver down through the fissure. Quill eyes him.

YONDU

So why’d Ego want you here? 

QUILL

He needs my genetic connection to 
the light to help destroy the 
universe. He tried to teach me how 
to control the power.

YONDU

So could you? 

QUILL

A little. I made a ball.

YONDU

A ball?

QUILL

I thought as hard as a could, 
that’s all I could come up with.

YONDU

You ‘thought’? 

Quill nods.

YONDU (CONT’D)

You think when I make this arrow 
fly I use my head?

QUILL

What do you use?

They look at each other instead of where they’re going, and 
the CRASH into an overhanging piece of rock.  

The entire side door is RIPPED OFF. 

As the SCREECH through a smaller space and into --

INT. PLANET’S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY

The Laser Drill DROPS into this enormous open space within 
the planet.  

The Guardians gather on the side of the ship open to the 
hollow, gazing out at its stunning beauty, lit by Ego’s white 
glow running throughout it.  

GAMORA

Whoa.

Mantis turns, looking through the portholes on the other 
side.

MANTIS

There! Thats Ego’s core.

Mantis points at the Self Chamber, down below them.  They 
twist down towards it.

GAMORA

That ore’s thick. Rocket, we’re 
gonna need to use the big laser.

Rocket nods, FLICKS switches. 

All the small lasers on the sides move through grooves to 
combine into one huge laser in the center of the ship: the 
MEGA-LASER.

MANTIS

We must hurry. It will not take Ego 
long to find us.

ROCKET

Keep it still!

Quill steadies the craft as best he can beside the Self 
Chamber.  But it’s an unwieldy beast, built for power, not 
precision. 

Rocket powers up the mega-laser and holds tight to the 
SHUDDERING CONTROLS as it DRILLS, BURNING a HOLE into the 
protective sheathe. It melts and drips down.

QUILL

We drill into the center, we kill 
him.

Quill holds tight to the steering wheel. Yondu notices the
BLINKING LIGHT on the comm. He taps it.

YONDU

What is it, Kraglin?

KRAGLIN (O.S.)

Um, remember that Ayesha chick?

YONDU

Yeah, why?

Yondu looks out the window where AYESHA’S SQUADRON is 
SWOOPING OUT OF the cracks in the ceiling all around them.

YONDU (CONT’D)

Aw, hell.

Quill PULLS AWAY from the envoys.

But the Sovereign envoys start BLASTING AT THE CRAFT all at 
once; the LASER LOSES POWER and the VEHICLE TURNS SIDEWAYS - 

Drax, Mantis, and Gamora GO TUMBLING from the hole in the 
side. Nebula and Groot grab onto the floor.

INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Gamora, Drax, and Mantis FALL from an incredible height. They 
LAND - ONE, TWO, THREE - WITH APLOMB.  

Gamora looks up and sees the Laser Drill CURL behind the Self 
Chamber as it tries to avoid the envoys’ BLASTERS. 

INT. SELF CHAMBER/LASER DRILL - DAY

Nebula and Groot settle as the ship rights itself and BLASTS 
PIERCE the ship around them.  

Quill peers down at Rocket, who has jumped out of his seat 
and is pouring out the contents of his satchel.

QUILL

Why aren’t you firing the laser?!

ROCKET

They blew out the generator!
I think I packed a small detonator.

NEBULA

A detonator is worthless without 
explosives!

ROCKET

We got these!

Rocket shows Nebula the Anulax batteries.

Quill leaves the controls to Yondu as he CLIMBS down beside 
Rocket, now messing with wiring on his BOMB.

QUILL

Is it strong enough to kill Ego?

ROCKET

If it is, it will cause a chain 
reaction throughout his entire 
nervous system.

QUILL

Meaning what?

ROCKET

The entire planet will explode. 
We’ll have to get out of here fast.
I rigged a timer.

Rocket stuffs the bomb back in his satchel.  Groot climbs on 
his back.  

Rocket and Quill slap on their AERO RIGS.

QUILL

Go!

The run and jump out of the laser drill, FLYING ON THEIR AERO 
RIGS, avoiding the GUNFIRE.

The ZOOM towards the blast hole on the side of the self 
chamber.

INT. OPENING OF BLAST HOLE - DAY

Rocket and Quill land here, messily, TUMBLING. 

ELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Mantis is worried about something else entirely; the entire 
chasm begins TREMBLING and the walls start to MUTATE.  

MANTIS

He’s coming.

DRAX

Didn’t you say you could make him 
sleep?

MANTIS

When he wants! He’s too powerful! I 
can’t!

DRAX

You don’t have to believe in 
yourself because I believe in you.

They look ahead. They see, on the enormous wall in front of 
them, the LIGHT-FORM of a giant EGO SCREAMING ANGRILY.

His SCREAM becomes a TUNNEL OF ROCKS RUSHING TOWARDS THEM 
like a train.

Mantis sees a nerve bundle on the ground coming from Ego’s 
Core. Although afraid, she grabs it.

MANTIS

SLEEP!

She SCREAMS with effort and some pain as energy travels 
through the bundle and into the core, where it darkens.

The LIGHT LEAVES THE ROCK FORMATION and it SLAMS into the 
ground in front of them, SPLASHING DIRT OVER THEM. 

But they are safe, shivering. Drax and Gamora look at each 
other.

DRAX

I never thought she’d be able to do 
it. With as skinny and weak as she 
appears to be.

Mantis’s arm is TREMBLING.

MANTIS

I don’t know how long I can hold 
him!
GAMORA

You need to, girl. If you don’t 
keep Ego at bay, we all die.

INT. OPENING OF BLAST HOLE - DAY

Rocket shines a powerful PEN-LIGHT inside the cavity, 
exposing the interior, spattered with Swiss-cheese-like holes 
glowing with light. 

ROCKET

The metal is too thick! For the 
bomb to work we’d actually need to 
place it on Ego’s core.  And our 
fat butts ain’t gonna fit through 
those tiny holes.

QUILL

Well...

Quill slowly eyes Groot, who is playing with a leaf on his 
arm and thinking about something else entirely. 

ROCKET

That’s a terrible idea.

QUILL

Which is the only kind of idea we 
got left.

Rocket SIGHS. He puts Groot on his back and MOVES with Groot 
deeper into the blast hole, mumbling to himself:

ROCKET

Unbelievable. ‘Rocket, do this. 
Rocket, do that.’

Quill turns toward the opening. PUSH UP AND IN ON QUILL.

QUILL

Uh, what a day.

He jumps out into the fray.

INT. PLANET’S HOLLOW - DAY

Quill FLIES UP as a ship FLIES in toward him BLASTING, and 
he’s about to fire back.  MAN VS. SPACESHIP. This is most 
likely the beginning of the biggest, baddest fight scene 
ever, but instead we CUT TO -

INT. INSIDE BLAST HOLE - DAY

Quiet. Blasts in the deep background. Rocket places a tiny 
bomb in front of Groot.  It is a small, simple device with 
two switches and two buttons.  He explains, very carefully:

ROCKET

All right. First you flick this 
switch, then this switch. That 
activates it.  And then you push 
this button, which will give you 
five minutes to get out of there. 
Whatever you do don’t push this 
button, because that will set off 
the bomb immediately, and we’ll all 
be dead. Now repeat back what I 
just said.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

Uh huh.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

That’s right.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

No! That’s the button that will 
kill everyone! Try again.

Groot thinks.

GROOT

I am Groot.

Rocket nods.

GROOT (CONT’D)

I am Groot.

Rocket nods.

GROOT (CONT’D)

I am Groot.

ROCKET

No! That’s exactly what you just 
said! How is that even possible?! 
Which button is the button you’re 
supposed to push?! Point to it.

Groot thinks. And he points to the one that will kill 
everyone.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

NO!!!

QUILL (O.S.)

Hey, you’re making him nervous!

Rocket runs to see, at the end of the hole, a sliver of the 
outside as Quill peeks in while SHOOTING at envoys.

ROCKET

Shut up! And give me some tape! 
Does anyone have any tape out 
there!? I want to put some tape 
over the death button!

QUILL

I don’t have any tape.  Let me 
check.

Quill disappears from the hole.  As Rocket waits, he hears, 
amongst the chaos, faintly -

QUILL (O.S.) (CONT’D)

Yo, Yondu, do you have any - ow! - 
do you have any tape?!

O.S. GUN BLASTS.

We hear VOICES GRUMBLING.

Rocket and Groot look around, waiting. Rocket is impatient. 
He coughs. Groot is like a bored kid in a waiting room.  He 
shifts around and plays with the wires on the bomb. 

Quill reappears outside the hole, SHOOTING an envoy.

QUILL (CONT’D)

No one has any tape.

ROCKET

Not a single person has tape?

QUILL

You have priceless batteries and an 
atomic bomb in your bag! If anyone 
had tape it would be you!

ROCKET

That’s exactly my point! I have to 
do everything!

QUILL

Dude, you’re wasting time!

Rocket turns back to Groot, who has already taken the bomb 
and is heading towards the hole. 

He makes a “WHEEEEEE” sound and smiles brightly as he HOPS 
into the hole and SLIDES down as if on a water slide.

Rocket, heavy-lidded, watches him go.

ROCKET

We’re all gonna die.

INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY

Yondu and Nebula, in the cockpit, are being overcome as 
blasts come through the walls.

YONDU

We’re done for without the 
generator.

Nebula MOANS, frustrated. She flips open a section of the 
dashboard, then a part of her arm.

INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY

The remaining Sovereign envoys have ENCIRCLED the battered 
Laser Drill, BLASTING IT TO BITS.  

Quill FLIES into the Laser Drill, SLAMMING into the wall.

AYESHA (ON SHIP)

Guardians! Perhaps it will provide 
you solace that your deaths are not 
without purpose.  

Nebula is feeding the wires from the craft into her 
mechanical arm. 

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

The actual Ayesha, fitted with the pilot gear, looks at the 
Laser Drill on the screen.

AYESHA

They will serve as a warning to all 
of those tempted with betraying us; 
don’t screw with the Sovereign. 

INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY

Yondu works some switches: The LASERS slide back into the 
slots all over the ship.

YONDU

This is gonna hurt.

NEBULA

Promises, promises.

Yondu flips ALL the switches; ALL THE POWER RUNS PAINFULLY 
OUT OF NEBULA’S BODY INTO THE VEHICLE --

AND THE LASERS BEAM OUT OF THE SHIP IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT 
ONCE, like a dangerous disco ball, slicing through almost 
nearly every single ENVOY.

INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

A BEAM ALMOST HITS Drax, but he LEAPS out of the way.  Smoke 
rises from a hole in the ground between him and Mantis.

DRAX

Hey! 

INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY

With flair, Yondu spins the pilot’s wheel, so that the whole 
rig REVOLVES.

Ayesha looks on, in horror as the BEAMS SLICE THROUGH the 
remaining CRAFT - and one is COMING HER WAY.

AYESHA (ON SHIP)

NO!!

AYESHA’S ENVOY IS RIPPED APART.

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

Ayesha SITS BACK. She looks around her at the other pods: all 
of them are down.  

AYESHA

NO! NOOOOO!!

INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY

Quill sees FLAMING CHUNKS FLY into the rig...

And FIRE SPILLING toward the ship’s engine, dripping fuel.

QUILL

We’re gonna blow!

Yondu WHISTLES as the FLAMES HIT THE FUEL -

INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Gamora watches as the ENTIRE LASER DRILL EXPLODES.  She is 
stricken. 

GAMORA

Peter?

She sees a tiny body flying from the ship - it’s Nebula, who 
LANDS across from her on her feet.  

Gamora looks at her, worried.  Nebula gives her what might be 
a little smile, and looks upward. Gamora follows her line of 
sight.

Quill is FLYING FROM THE EXPLOSION on his aero-rig. Yondu is 
holding onto a flying arrow: his one arm up straight, his 
heels touching. Quill looks at him and SNICKERS.

YONDU

What?

QUILL

You look like Mary Poppins.

YONDU

Is he cool?

Quill looks at the man who raised him. He smiles.

QUILL

Yeah. He’s cool.

Yondu looks out at the Guardians as he comes in for a 
landing.

YONDU

I’m Mary Poppins, y’all!

Quill and Yondu LAND beside Nebula. Gamora sees Quill and 
MARCHES TOWARD HIM. 

The CAMERA CIRCLES GAMORA AND QUILL, FIERY SHIP FRAGMENTS 
RAINING DOWN AROUND THEM IN SLOW-MOTION, as if this is the 
greatest heavy metal video of all time. 

The other Guardians enter, one by one - Nebula, Drax, Yondu, 
Rocket FLYING DOWN on his aero-rig, and finally, Mantis, 
staring forward with concentration until --

A HUGE CHUNK OF SPACESHIP FLIES IN FROM THE SIDE, FLATTENING 
MANTIS. The others all look down at her in shock.

QUILL

Oh. Wow.

Mantis, UNCONSCIOUS BENEATH a ship fragment, has lost hold of 
Ego.

THE ENTIRE HOLLOW AROUND THEM BEGINS TO RUMBLE.  THE GROUND 
AND WALLS THEMSELVES SHIFT and WAVER.  

The whole cavity is alive. Drax checks on Mantis.

DRAX

She’s just unconscious.

INT. SELF CHAMBER TUNNELS - DAY

Groot RUNS and HOPS through the tunnels. He comes to a 
crossroads.

He sees a COSMIC LIGHT emanating from one tunnel.  He dashes 
off toward it.

INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

QUILL

How long before the bomb goes off?

ROCKET

In the unlikely event Groot doesn’t 
kill us all, about six minutes.

Yondu speaks into the comm on his lapel.

YONDU

Kraglin.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Kraglin, NODDING OUT, abruptly wakes.

YONDU (O.S.)

We need the Quadrant for extraction 
in T-minus five minutes.

KRAGLIN

Aye, Cap’n!

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Our heroes peer up to see the SURFACE OF THE PLANET UNFOLDING 
ABOVE THEM, so that THE BRIGHT SKY SHINES THROUGH.  

QUILL

Someone needs to be up top when 
Kraglin arrives. Drax, take Mantis.

Drax nods. He picks up Mantis.  Quill grabs the aero-rig off 
himself and SLAPS it on Drax’s back, which AUTOMATICALLY 
WRAPS around his upper body.

DRAX

Ahhh! My nipples!

He FLIES UPWARD.

The ground around them SPLITS INTO ENORMOUS CRACKS. Gamora 
sees a CRACK IN THE EARTH RUSHING TOWARD her and Quill, and 
she turns toward him.

And Gamora’s side CRUMBLES AWAY, GAMORA FALLING DOWN with it.

QUILL

Gamora!!

HUGE BURSTS OF EARTH SHOOT UP all around Drax, Yondu, Rocket, 
and Quill.  

The planet has formed GIANT TENTACLES THAT HURTLE towards our 
heroes.

EXT. LOWER RIFT - DAY

Gamora is PLUMMETING, seemingly to her death, when she looks 
over and sees Nebula FALLING just behind her.  

Nebula grabs Gamora’s arm and then grabs onto a passing 
cliff.  

They SNAP TO A STOP- OW! - hanging down off the side.  

Nebula tosses Gamora up onto a flat surface. 

As Nebula climbs up after her, Gamora looks at her, wary but 
surprised by this beneficence.

NEBULA

Oh, get over it.

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Quill BLASTS a tentacle. 

Yondu WHISTLES, the ARROW WEAVING THROUGH TENTACLES around 
them.  

Rocket TOSSES a bunch of tiny bombs at some, which they stick 
to and EXPLODE. 

But they are by no means winning this fight.

EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY

The giant Quadrant LOWERS toward the surface. 

EXT. LOWER RIFT - DAY

Gamora looks at Nebula.

GAMORA

We have to get up to the extraction 
point!

They look over the edge and see a huge RIFT OF LAND RISING 
QUICKLY.  They look at each other and JUMP -

They GRAB ONTO THE EDGE of the rising rift, CLUTCHING TO IT 
as it FLIES upward toward the open space above them.

EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY

Drax FLIES UP onto the surface; he sees the Quadrant waiting 
for him there.  He DARTS for the ship.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Kraglin opens the LOADING DOOR

EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY

But huge swatches of the planet reach up and GRAB onto the 
Quadrant, YANKING IT DOWN.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Kraglin, freaking out, throws the thrusters into high gear.

I/E. PLANET SURFACE/QUADRANT LOADING BAY - DAY

The thrusters FLARE as the massive ship STRUGGLES to free 
itself from Ego’s tendrils.  

And it does PULL ITSELF UP for a moment, but the tendrils 
tighten, SLAMMING it back down.

The whole Quadrant starts to TIP OVER. Kraglin falls down 
against the side of the ship.

Drax sees the ship FALLING TOWARDS HIM and he RUNS away from 
it in fear.

But he arrives a the edge of a cliff.  He crouches as the 
ship CONTINUES DOWN toward him, about to SQUASH both he and 
Mantis --

But Kraglin heroically CRAWLS his way back up to the controls 
as he dangles from them.  He pushes on the thrusters, so that 
the ship goes back upright.

Drax turns and again RUNS toward the Quadrant.

EXT. PLANET’S HOLLOW - DAY

Gamora and Nebula are still rising on the rift when they SLAM 
into a wall near the opening in the surface of the planet. 

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Quill turns and sees Ego, in his terrifying SKELETAL LIGHT 
FORM, STROLLING DOWN TOWARDS HIM as the land around him PARTS 
LIKE THE RED SEA. 

As Ego walks, THE DIRT AND MOLECULES AROUND EGO FORM ORGANS 
IN HIS BODY, piecing himself back together.

Quill sees a tentacle SLAM Yondu to the ground and COVER HIS 
ENTIRE BODY.  

He turns to see Rocket HOLLERING as he FIRES at tentacles, 
but they OVERWHELM him. 

EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY

The earth WRAPS AROUND Drax’s legs like quicksand, pulling 
him and Mantis down into it.

EXT. PLANET’S HOLLOW - DAY

Gamora and Nebula scramble, trying to CLIMB BACK UP, when 
TENDRILS WRAP AROUND THEM, stopping them from going further.

INT. SELF CHAMBER TUNNELS - DAY

The walls are tightening around Groot. He grows his branches 
to try to stop them, but they aren’t working. 

He begins to CRY, like an actual baby, terrified, on the 
brink of suffocating.

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Ego approaches his son. He is fully formed, and he is more 
truly “himself.” Alien. Dark eyes and pale skin.

EGO

I told you I don’t want to do this 
alone. 

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

EGO

You cannot deny the purpose the 
universe has bestowed upon you!

And once again, the LIGHT TENDRILS STAB THROUGH QUILL’S BACK, 
thrusting him to his knees.  

Smaller light tendrils stab into his face and body.

And we see the LIGHT being sucked out of Quill and up into 
the Self Chamber once more as it BURSTS WITH LIGHT.

EARTH - EXT. STREET - DAY

POLICE OFFICERS and bystanders are in the streets, snapping 
phone photos, etc, beside the HUGE, STILL SWATCH OF EGO’S 
LIFEFORM.

OFFICER FITZGIBBON

Please, everyone. Step back. I need 
you all to clear the -

WEIRD OLD MAN

What is that?

The LIFEFORM ALIGHTS WITH ENERGY and MOVES again, SPILLING
INCREDIBLY QUICKLY towards them.

People abandon their cars in traffic as it RUNS OVER THEM. 

A WOMAN FALLS. People TRAMPLE around her.  

But an old man’s hands reach in, helping her up. 

REVEAL GRANDPA QUILL, in his 70’s or 80’s now. 

GRANDPA QUILL

Come on, ma’am.

He HELPS the woman into an SUV.  

He SLAMS on the gas, SCREECHING AWAY from the enormous tidal 
wave of organic light. 

XANDAR - I/E. STARBLASTER/CITY - DAY

EGO’S LIFEFORM smashes down the PARK WALLS and into the 
street.

EGO

(O.S)

It doesn’t need to be like this 
Peter

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Ego approaches his son. 

EGO

Why are you destroying our chance?! 

AAKON - EXT. AAKON CITY - NIGHT

AAKONS run from a giant wave behind them.

EGO

(O.S)

Stop pretending you aren’t, what 
you are!

KREE HOMEWORLD - EXT. STEEP HILLSIDE - DAY

KREE MONKS run from the cosmic flesh as it pours down the 
hillside behind them. 

But it’s too fast, RUSHING OVER THEM.

PRIMITIVE PLANET - EXT. WETLANDS - DAY

THOUSANDS OF ORLONI are darting in fear across this dusty 
desert, as it WASHES OVER them.

EGO

(O.S)

One in billions..

ARAGO-7 - EXT. STONY LANDSCAPE - DAY

THREE HURCTARIANS run, SCREAMING.

EGO

(O.S)

Trillions, even more!

EASIK - EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

AN EASIK MOTHER clutches her BABY, covering it with her own 
body, as the spreading lifeform LOOMS UP behind her.

She closes her eyes and waits for the worst.

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Quill looks up at Ego, barely able to focus, as the molecules 
form skin over the muscle and skeleton and innards beneath.  

EGO

What greater meaning could life 
possibly have to offer?!

Yondu struggles beneath the tentacle beside Quill.

YONDU

I don’t use my head to fly the 
arrow, boy! I use my h -

Quill hears this as the earth COVERS Yondu’s face.

Quill LOOKS INWARD. And suddenly, everything becomes...

QUIET.

Tears come to Peter Quill’s eyes as he remember those around 
him and what they mean to him.  And we see his MEMORIES.

- YOUNG PETER QUILL AND HIS MOTHER CUDDLED AND LISTENING TO 
MUSIC ON THE WALKMAN TOGETHER, EACH WITH ONE EAR PIECE.

- QUILL AND DRAX LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY ON THE MILANO.

- GAMORA AND PETER LOOKING INTO EACH OTHER’S EYES AND DANCING 
ON KNOWHERE.

- QUILL AND ROCKET FLYING THROUGH THE SKY ON AERO-RIGS FOR 
THE FIRST TIME, SMILING AS THE AIR RUSHES THROUGH THEIR HAIR. 
BABY GROOT CLUTCHES HAPPILY ONTO QUILL’S BACK.

- YONDU AND YOUNG QUILL IN THE FOREST. YONDU’S ARM IS ON 
PETER’S ARM AS HE TEACHES HIM HOW TO SHOOT.

Quill looks back up at Ego as we HEAR the gentle chords of 
FLEETWOOD MAC’S “THE CHAIN” starts echoing throughout the 
hollow. 

He clutches his fist and we see the light growing within it.

122

Bits of earth begin to ROLL UP AND SCRAMBLE AND SWIRL around 
Quill’s body, his arms, his legs, as if he’s pulling them 
towards himself with magnets. 

And Ego looks confused, as the GROUND QUAKES AROUND HIM.

Quill glares at his father, his voice distorting with 
Celestial thunder.

QUILL

You shouldn’t have killed my mom 
and squished my walkman.

Ahd a SOLID TORNADO OF EARTH PROPELS QUILL FORWARD.  Ego 
tries to protect himself as Quill SLAMS into him, FLYING 
UPWARDS WITH HIM --

Quill raises his fist, NOW A GIANT CLUB.  And he SMASHES Ego.

As Ego loses his concentration --

EXT. PLANET’S SURFACE - DAY

A pair of arms are protruding from the surface of the planet, 
still holding Mantis aloft. 

The earth falls away, and Drax, who was entirely covered, 
heaves for breath.

EXT. CRACK IN PLANET - DAY

The TENDRILS FALL, freeing Gamora and Nebula as they GASP.

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Yondu BREAKS THROUGH THE ROCKS around him, drawing in breath.

The TENTACLES HOLDING ROCKET ALOFT CRUMBLE, and he looks 
around, confused.

EARTH - EXT. ST. CHARLES, MISSOURI - DAY

The WAVE PUSHES UP against the back of Grandpa Quill’s CAMARO 
and suddenly STOPS: 

the mountainous plant, a hundred stories high, is up against 
the back of the car. 

EASIK - EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

The Easik Mother clutching her baby looks behind her; the 
wave has stopped.

She clutches her baby to her chest, relieved.

INT. SELF CHAMBER TUNNELS - DAY

The tunnel around Groot SNAPS BACK to what it was. Once more 
he can see the light at the tunnel’s end, and one looks like 
a GIANT BRAIN composed of prismatic light.

He RUNS forward.

INT. INSIDE BLAST HOLE - DAY

Rocket flies up and yells at Groot.

ROCKET

Groot! Groot, if you can can hear 
me, hurry up - I’m not sure how 
long Quill can keep him distracted!

INT. SELF CHAMBER CORE - DAY

Groot ARRIVES at the end of the tunnel, and stops there.  

The center of the core holds a huge cosmic placenta, and, 
within that, EGO’S TRUE SELF, the COSMIC BRAIN.  It ROILS 
FURIOUSLY, the reflection of its fight with Quill, thrashing 
around within this womb.  

Although afraid, Groot places the bomb on the placenta. 

Groot stares at both buttons, scared - he doesn’t know which 
one to pick.

Groot makes a decision on which button to press. He goes to 
push the death button. 

Then his finger STOPS just millimeters from the button, 
TREMBLING.  He thinks... 

And then changes the course of his finger, PUSHING THE 
CORRECT BUTTON. 

THE COUNTDOWN CLOCK COMMENCES. 

Baby Groot turns, terrified, and RUNS.

I/E. PLANET SURFACE/QUADRANT LOADING BAY - DAY

Drax moves with Mantis into the loading bay.  He throws her 
down and climbs up a ladder. 

THE CAMERA SWINGS TO GAMORA AND NEBULA, climbing up to the 
surface in the dirt storm.

124

INT. PLANETS HOLLOW - DAY

Ego RISES on his own MOLECULAR TORNADO and STRIKES BACK at 
Quill.  He YELLS as he SLAMS Quill against the wall, DRAGGING 
his face along the wall.

He TOSSES Quill into a another wall.

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER/PLANET’S HOLLOW - DAY

QUILL brings his ARM FILLED WITH LIGHT away from the wall, so 
that he causes a WAVE OF LIGHT AND ROCK around the interior 
of the hollow, FLYING TO EGO and knocking him aside. 

Yondu protects his face as DIRT SWIRLS in the wake of the 
Quill/Ego battle.  

Rocket, carrying Groot, FLIES BACK DOWN beside him.

ROCKET

Yondu! We’re about to blow!

YONDU

Get to the ship.

ROCKET

Not without Quill.

YONDU

You gotta take care of the twig. 

ROCKET

Not without you.

YONDU

I ain’t done nothing right my whole 
damn life, rat. You need to give me 
this.

Rocket, hesitantly, nods.  He grabs some things from his bag.  
He hands them to Yondu.

ROCKET

A space suit and an aero rig. I 
only have one of each.

Yondu nods. Rocket nods too. 

Rocket starts to go, but STOPS and looks at Yondu.  

He wants to say something, but he doesn’t know what. Baby 
Groot does. 

GROOT

I am Groot.

YONDU

What’s that?

ROCKET

He says welcome to the frickin’
Guardians of the Galaxy... only he 
didn’t use ‘frickin’.

YONDU

Bye, twig.

Groot waves. 

And Rocket FLIES UP toward the surface. Rocket mutters to 
Groot.

ROCKET

We’re gonna need to have a 
discussion about your language.

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER/PLANET’S HOLLOW - DAY

Ego SLAMS Quill back against a wall. Ego pulls the huge rocks 
away from the wall, FLYING THEM TOWARDS HIM and BATTERING HIM 
THERE.

Ego and Quill FLY TOWARDS each other.

Ego uses the LIGHT TO BRING ROCKS TO HIS BODY, forming a 
giant AVATAR OF HIMSELF.

Quill brings YELLOW ROCKS to his body, forming a GIANT PAC-
MAN.

Ego’s form flies into Pac-Man’s mouth, so hard there’s a 
SONIC BOOM. 

They fall, TUMBLING, still striking one another on the way 
down. 

They LAND HARD.

INT. SELF CHAMBER CORE - DAY

The timer counts down.  A minute left.

I/E. PLANET SURFACE/QUADRANT LOADING BAY - DAY

Gamora and Nebula are caring for Mantis as Rocket and Groot 
ARRIVE.

GAMORA

Where’s Peter? 

Rocket doesn’t answer. Or he can’t answer.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

Rocket, where is he?!

Rocket looks down at a timer in his hand. The time is almost 
there. 

GAMORA (CONT’D)

Rocket?! Rocket, look at me! Where 
is he?!

Rocket just shakes his head a little. 

But Groot points sadly outside. 

GAMORA (CONT’D)

I’m not leaving without him.

Gamora hardens. She stands and SNATCHES A RIFLE off the wall. 
She COCKS IT.  

She STARTS OUT the bay door --

When AN ELECTRICAL BLAST HITS HER from behind.  

She FALLS OVER, unconscious, REVEALING Rocket with his gun. 

ROCKET

I’m sorry. I can only afford to 
lose one friend today. 

(into comm)

Kraglin, GO!

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Drax looks uncertain as Kraglin presses thrust.

DRAX

Wait. Is Quill back?

(into comm)

Rocket, where’s Quill?!

I/E. PLANET SURFACE/QUADRANT LOADING BAY - DAY

Rocket looks sadly out the bay door as it CLOSES; Drax’s 
voice echoes on his comm.

DRAX (O.S.)

Where’s Quill?!  WHERE’S QUILL?!
EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Quill and Ego are exhausted, on their knees and leaning 
against one another like boxers after too many rounds.

INT. SELF CHAMBER CORE - DAY

The timer reads 00:26 seconds

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Ego reaches for the core..

EGO

No, we need to stop it!

Quill throws him to the ground. But Ego comes back up, 
grasping his son’s jacket, pleading with him now.

EGO (CONT’D)

Listen to me! You are a god! If you 
kill me, you’ll just be like 
everyone else!

QUILL

What’s so wrong with that?

Ego looks at his son, scared.  

EGO

NO -

INT. SELF CHAMBER CORE - DAY

The countdown reaches zero.  The brain EXPLODES.

I/E. EGO’S NERVOUS SYSTEM - DAY

The explosion causes the life forces to BURST THROUGH THE 
ENTIRE PLANET.

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Everything around Quill is EXPLODING. 

He looks down at his hands, where the glow FADES and 
DISAPPEARS. 

He gazes up at the mammoth walls around him as they BLOW UP 
and COLLAPSE.  

He lowers at head, at peace with the death that’s coming, 
when, from the side, through the debris --


YONDU IS FLYING TOWARDS HIM ON AN AERO-RIG.  

Yondu GRABS him, almost a tackle, really, LIFTING HIM up and 
FLYING AWAY.

EXT. PLANET'S HOLLOW - DAY

As Yondu and Quill FLY UPWARD, the planet EXPLODES behind 
them, flames licking their heels, huge stretches of the 
planet caving in.

EXT. SKY - DAY

Yondu holds a surprised Quill as they SOAR up into the sky, 

YONDU

He may have been your father, boy.  
But he wasn’t your daddy.

QUILL

What?

YONDU

I’m sorry I didn’t do it right. I’m 
damn lucky you’re my boy.

Quill is touched.

Yondu SLAPS the SPACESUIT disk onto Quill; THE SHIMMERY 
SHEATHE COVERS HIM.

QUILL

What?

Yondu breathes out as completely as he can, emptying his 
lungs.  And they EXIT THE PLANET’S ATMOSPHERE, bursting into -

EXT. SPACE - OUTER SPACE

Quill struggles to get free, but Yondu holds him there, 
trapping him, but it is also an embrace. The ENTIRE PLANET is 
COLLAPSING BEHIND THEM.

QUILL

Yondu, you can’t!  What are you 
doing?  What are you doing?!

Yondu’s jet pack expires its supply of fuel, and they STOP 
THERE, in space, FLOATING.  

Yondu’s grip weakens. Quill turns to face him.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Yondu. Yondu, no! 


Yondu grabs his son’s face with both hands, looking and 
touching him with love.  

QUILL (CONT’D)

No.

And Yondu’s FACE EXPANDS and his BODY GOES LIMP as he DIES
there.  And he starts to DRIFT AWAY.  Quill grabs onto his 
shirt. He is CRYING.

QUILL (CONT’D)

No!

And, suddenly, behind Quill, Rocket and Drax PROPEL 
themselves toward him in aero-rigs, GRABBING him.

FADE TO BLACK

INT. ECLECTOR CREMATORY - LATER

Yondu’s body lies on a plank here: Various colored cloths are 
laid in strips over his body and face, yaro lilies beneath 
him, red-fired pyres and Yondu’s toys all around.  

Rocket, Groot, Drax, Gamora, Mantis, and Kraglin surround the 
table.  Quill is at the head. He has to say a few words. But 
it is not easy.

QUILL

The other day I told Gamora how I 
used to pretend my dad was David 
Hasselhoff.  

Rocket and Drax exchange a look.

QUILL (CONT’D)

He’s a singer and actor from 
earth... a really famous guy.

Drax nods.

QUILL (CONT’D)

And, you know, today it struck me.  
Yondu didn’t have a talking car, 
but he did have a flying arrow.  
And he didn’t have the voice of an 
angel, but he did have the whistle 
of one.  And both David Hasselhoff
and Yondu went on kickass
adventures, and hooked up with hot 
women, and fought robots.  

So, the thing is, David Hasselhoff
kinda did end up being my Dad after 
all, only he was Yondu.  I had a 
pretty cool Dad.

Quill starts to break down.

QUILL (CONT’D)

And what I’m trying to say here is, 
that thing you’re searching for 
your whole life, sometimes it’s 
right there by your side all along 
and you don’t even know it.

Gamora sees Nebula, watching from a darkened doorway, before 
she turns and walks away. She moves after her.

Groot looks up at an upset Rocket.

GROOT

I am Groot?

ROCKET

Yeah. That’s the friend I was 
talking about.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

He did call you ‘twig.’

INT. QUADRANT SMALL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Gamora catches up to Nebula in the hall.

GAMORA

Nebula.

Nebula turns toward her, but she doesn’t look her in the eye.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

I was just a child. Like you. I was 
concerned with staying alive until 
the next day - every day. And I 
never considered what Thanos was 
doing to you.  I am sorry.

Nebula nods.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

I’m trying to make it right, 
everything I did. 

QUILL (CONT’D)

(MORE)

There are little girls like you 
were - little boys - all over the 
universe - who are in danger. You 
can stay with us, and help them.

NEBULA

I’ll help them by killing Thanos.

GAMORA

I don’t know if that’s possible.

Nebula shrugs: maybe.  She turns to leave. But Gamora grabs 
her, perhaps too roughly.  Nebula turns, ready to snap.

And Gamora EMBRACES her. Nebula does not know how to react.  

GAMORA (CONT’D)

You’ll always be my sister.

Tears well in Nebula’s eyes and, for just a moment, she 
embraces her sister back with one hand...

Before pushing her away and leaving.

INT. ECLECTOR CREMATORY - MOMENTS LATER

The Guardians lift Yondu on the plank.  A bulbous and rusty 
crematory is at the center of the room. It doesn’t burn with 
fire, but a SWIRLING, VIBRANT COSMIC ENERGY.

They SLIDE YONDU IN as they watch with sadness and respect as 
his body is enveloped by the sparkling colors.  Quill closes 
the door on the crematory. 

As Quill moves away, Kraglin approaches.  

KRAGLIN

Pete. 

Quill turns toward him. He’s holding something.

KRAGLIN (CONT’D)

Cap’n found this for you in a 
junker shop. Said someday you’d 
come back to the fold.

Kraglin puts an MP3 player in his hand.

KRAGLIN (CONT’D)

It’s called a Zune - what everyone 
listens to on earth nowadays. It’s 
got three hundred songs.

Quill nods, touched.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

132

QUILL

Wait.

Quill holds out Yondu’s arrow.  Kraglin’s lip trembles.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Rocket grabbed the pieces and 
reassembled them. I think Yondu 
would want you to have it.

KRAGLIN

Thank you... Cap’n.

EXT. QUADRANT - OUTER SPACE

Yondu’s SPARKLING ASHES ARE BLOWN OUT IN SPURTS FROM THE 
CREMATORY INTO SPACE.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Rocket, Drax, and Mantis are here, watching Yondu’s ashes in 
the vacuum of space, SWIRLING almost magically. 

INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - OUTER SPACE

Quill sits down on the bed in Yondu’s quarters.  He scrolls 
through selections on the Zune.  

He comes to “FATHER AND SON” by CAT STEVENS. 

He PRESSES PLAY.

He listens.  As he does, Groot crawls up onto the bed, and 
then onto his lap. 

Quill offers him one of the ear buds.  

Groot holds it against his ear, amazed by the clarity of 
sound. Quill watches him, hearing the beauty of the song more 
through Groot’s face than the music itself.

And they sit there together, listening to the music, a new 
father and son.

INT. M-SHIP - OUTER SPACE

Nebula FLIES AWAY, sad, perhaps regretful, but forcing her 
chin up to brace against what’s to come. 

INT. QUADRANT SMALL HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE

Gamora watches, THROUGH A WINDOW, as Nebula leaves. 

133

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Rocket sees something by the ashes.  His eyes alight.

ROCKET

They came.

INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - OUTER SPACE

Groot sees COLORFUL FLASHING LIGHTS out of the window.  He 
pulls on Quill’s shirt to show him.  

They go to get a better view.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Drax and Rocket see Yondu’s COSMIC ASHES PULSING AND SWIRLING
out in space as, one by one, enormous RAVAGER SHIPS arrive 
around them.  

They each FLASH SPECIFIC LIGHT SEQUENCES - and, with all the 
ships together - it looks like fireworks.

DRAX

What is it?

ROCKET

I sent word to Yondu’s old Ravager 
buddies and told them what he did.

Quill comes up behind them with Groot, just as Gamora enters.  
Quill smiles.

QUILL

It’s a Ravager funeral.

INT. HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE

Kraglin sees it from here. He SCREAMS with joy, and he slams 
his fist twice against his chest, a Ravager salute.

I/E. RAVAGER FLIGHT DECK 1 - OUTER SPACE

STAKAR and Martinex watch him there, moved.

MARTINEX

He didn’t let us down after all, 
Cap’n.

STAKAR

No, he did not, son. He did not.

134

I/E. RAVAGER FLIGHT DECK 2 - OUTER SPACE

CHARLIE-27, an enormous man, is wistful as he salutes.

CHARLIE-27

Fare thee well, old friend.

I/E. RAVAGER FLIGHT DECK 3 - OUTER SPACE

ALETA is here, tears in her eyes, alcohol in her hand, an ALL-
FEMALE RAVAGER CREW around her.

ALETA

See you in the stars, Yondu Udonta.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

And the Guardians all watch, enchanted by the majesty. 

ROCKET

He didn’t chase ‘em away.

QUILL

No.

ROCKET

Even though he yelled at ‘em.

Quill shakes his head.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

And was always mean.

Quill shakes his head.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

And he stole batteries he didn’t 
need.

Quill is surprised - what? And then he looks at Rocket, a 
little animal who doesn’t know the rules of how to be any 
more than a young boy whose tribe sold him into slavery.

QUILL

Of course not.

Baby Groot is on Gamora’s shoulder.  He reaches for Drax, who 
takes him.  Baby Groot YAWNS and nuzzles into Drax’s 
shoulder, falling asleep. Drax lovingly pats his back.

Gamora looks at Drax and Groot, and Rocket, and Mantis, 
taking it all in, this strange family of hers.  She turns to 
Quill, staring at him with love.


QUILL (CONT’D)

What?

GAMORA

It’s just some unspoken thing.

Quill wraps his arm around her and she sinks into him. 

Mantis smiles and becomes teary and GASPS, overwhelmed, as 
she looks out the window.  

MANTIS

It’s beautiful.

DRAX

It is.  And so are you.

(beat)

On the inside.

They turn back to the window and they stand there together, 
our Guardians of the Galaxy, watching the Ravager funeral and 
the colorful dust of an old friend dance.  

And the shape of the dust seems to form something very close 
to an ARROW.

Rocket sees this and he cries.

THE END (NOT REALLY)

RUN CREDITS.

“SURRENDER” BY CHEAP TRICK PLAYS.

CREDIT BREAK 1 - INT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE

SURRENDER is PLAYING HERE.  Kraglin has had a version of 
Yondu’s fin implanted in his head.  He looks nervously down 
at the arrow on the floor.  

He tries to WHISTLE. It just flips around like a dead fish.

He WHISTLES again, and it FLIES UP, hitting a wall, and falls 
back down again.

He WHISTLES again, and it ZIPS AWAY.  We HEAR A SCREAM.

Kraglin looks around the corner where Drax is sitting, the 
ARROW IMPALED in his chest, yelling in agony.

Kraglin looks around, hoping no one saw him there, and he 
tries to slink away.

MORE CREDITS as SURRENDER CHORUS KICKS IN: Mommy’s all right, 
Daddy’s all right, they just seem a little weird.

END CREDITS - INT. STAKAR’S SHIP - OUTER SPACE

Stakar looks sad, serious.

STAKAR

It’s a shame it takes a tragedy 
like losing Yondu to bring us all 
back together. But I think he’d be 
proud if he knew we were working as 
a team again.

Over Stakar we see this incredibly motley crew - MARTINEX, 
CHARLIE-27, ALETA, who is holding MAINFRAME (a robotic head 
in a cage), and the mouthless, wormlike KRUGARR, 

STAKAR (CONT’D)

What say we steal some shit?

CHARLIE-27

In.

MARTINEX

Dope.

MAINFRAME

I MISSED you guys!

Krugarr makes a hex symbol and TWO COLORFUL THUMBS-UP BURST 
in front of him.

ALETA

Hell. Yes.

END CREDITS - INT. BIRTHING PODS CHAMBER - DAY

Ayesha sits on a bench, brooding, disheveled and still 
furious. The Chambermaid cautiously approaches. 

CHAMBERMAID

High Priestess, the Council is 
waiting.

AYESHA

They are perturbed I have wasted 
our resources.

The Chambermaid smiles politely, nods slightly, agreeing in a 
circumspect manner. Ayesha stares across the way.

AYESHA (CONT’D)

When they see what I have created 
here, their wrath will dissipate, 
though it will be some time. 

The Chambermaid looks where Ayesha is looking.

CHAMBERMAID

That is not just another birthing 
pod, ma’am?

AYESHA

That, my child, is the next step in 
our evolution: more powerful, more 
beautiful, and more capable of 
destroying the Guardians of the 
Galaxy. 

A large, human-sized cocoon stands where Ayesha stares.

AYESHA (CONT’D)

I think I shall call him... ‘Adam’.

BOX OVER CREDITS - INT. GROOT’S BEDROOM - OUTER SPACE

Quill is standing in the bedroom doorway, looking down.

QUILL

Dude, seriously, you got to clean 
up your room. It’s a complete mess.

We REVEAL a gawky ADOLESCENT GROOT, hunched over, playing a 
video game, in this very messy room. 

ADOLESCENT GROOT

I am Groot.

QUILL

I’m not boring, man. You’re boring.
Once I got stuck on a planet where 
everyone was just lines and dots. I 
had to use geometry to get out of 
prison. Is that boring?

Adolescent Groot shakes his head in disdain.

QUILL (CONT’D)

You know what’s boring? Not doing 
the dishes. What’s boring is me 
tripping over your vines 
everywhere.

Adolescent Groot SIGHS.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Drax and I switched pants in the 
middle of that party last weekend. 
For no reason other than we’re 
awesome and very much not boring.

Quill starts to walk away then comes back.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Once I got a venereal disease that 
made me float for three days... 
Don’t tell Gamora... it’s dormant, 
but... If that’s boring then, I 
guess I’m boring. 

He looks at him.

QUILL (CONT’D)

I’m not boring.

Groot ROLLS HIS EYES and makes an exasperated sound.

QUILL (CONT’D)

What’s boring is when you roll your 
eyes like that at me and make an 
exasperated sound like I’m an old, 
boring, stupid idiot. 

Quill thinks.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Now I know how Yondu felt.

Quill begins to CRY.
